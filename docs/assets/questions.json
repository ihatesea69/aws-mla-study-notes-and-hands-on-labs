    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn C (Use the SageMaker Model Registry and model groups): Đây là đáp án chính xác nhất vì Amazon SageMaker Model Registry là tính năng được thiết kế chuyên biệt (purpose-built) để quản lý vòng đời của mô hình. Khái niệm \"Model Group\" (Nhóm mô hình) trong Model Registry cho phép bạn gộp các phiên bản khác nhau của cùng một mô hình lại với nhau. Khi bạn đăng ký một mô hình mới vào một Model Group, SageMaker sẽ tự động đánh số phiên bản (version 1, 2, 3...) mà không cần thao tác thủ công phức tạp. Điều này đáp ứng hoàn hảo yêu cầu \"LEAST operational overhead\" (ít chi phí vận hành nhất). Tại sao không chọn A (Create a separate Amazon ECR repository for each model): Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry) là nơi lưu trữ Docker container images, không phải là nơi chuyên dụng để quản lý các artifact của mô hình ML hay metadata (như độ chính xác, tham số huấn luyện). Việc tạo một repo riêng cho từng mô hình sẽ gây ra sự lộn xộn, khó quản lý (management sprawl) và tốn rất nhiều công sức vận hành để theo dõi phiên bản, hoàn toàn đi ngược lại yêu cầu \"ít chi phí vận hành\". Tại sao không chọn B (Use Amazon ECR and unique tags): Mặc dù ECR hỗ trợ tags để đánh dấu phiên bản image, nhưng nó vẫn chỉ là nơi lưu trữ container image. Nó thiếu các tính năng cốt lõi của một Model Registry như: quy trình phê duyệt (approval workflows), theo dõi nguồn gốc (lineage tracking), và liên kết metadata của mô hình. Sử dụng ECR để thay thế Model Registry đòi hỏi phải xây dựng thêm các công cụ tùy chỉnh, gây tốn kém chi phí vận hành. Tại sao không chọn D (Use the SageMaker Model Registry and unique tags): Mặc dù sử dụng đúng dịch vụ là SageMaker Model Registry, nhưng cách dùng \"unique tags\" để quản lý phiên bản là không chính xác về mặt kỹ thuật và quy trình. Trong SageMaker Model Registry, cơ chế quản lý phiên bản chuẩn là thông qua Model Groups. Tags thường được dùng để thêm metadata (ví dụ: stage: production, project: alpha) chứ không phải là cơ chế chính để catalog các phiên bản mô h..."

    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn B (Use SageMaker managed warm pools): Đây là đáp án chính xác vì tính năng SageMaker managed warm pools cho phép giữ lại các instance (máy chủ) và tài nguyên đã được provision (cấp phát) ở trạng thái \"sẵn sàng\" (warm) sau khi một training job kết thúc. Khi chạy các job liên tiếp (consecutive training jobs), SageMaker có thể tái sử dụng ngay các instance này mà không cần tốn thời gian khởi động lại, tải container image hay cài đặt thư viện, giúp giảm đáng kể thời gian khởi động hạ tầng (infrastructure startup times). Tại sao không chọn A (Use Managed Spot Training): Managed Spot Training sử dụng dung lượng dư thừa của AWS EC2 để tiết kiệm chi phí (cost optimization). Tuy nhiên, nó không đảm bảo về thời gian khởi động và thậm chí có thể làm tăng thời gian chờ đợi nếu không có sẵn dung lượng Spot hoặc bị gián đoạn giữa chừng. Mục tiêu của Spot là \"giá rẻ\", không phải \"khởi động nhanh\". Tại sao không chọn C (Use SageMaker Training Compiler): SageMaker Training Compiler là một trình biên dịch giúp tối ưu hóa mã nguồn mô hình (model code) để tăng tốc độ huấn luyện (training throughput) bằng cách sử dụng hiệu quả hơn phần cứng GPU. Nó tập trung vào việc làm cho quá trình huấn luyện nhanh hơn, chứ không giúp giảm thời gian khởi động hạ tầng (provisioning phase). Tại sao không chọn D (Use the SageMaker distributed data parallelism library): Thư viện SMDDP được dùng để phân tán dữ liệu huấn luyện trên nhiều GPU/instance để huấn luyện nhanh hơn (parallel processing). Tương tự như đáp án C, nó giải quyết bài toán về tốc độ xử lý dữ liệu trong khi train, chứ không giải quyết vấn đề độ trễ khi khởi tạo tài nguyên ban đầu."

Trong kiến trúc MLOps của AWS, SageMaker Model Registry là thành phần trung tâm lưu trữ các phiên bản model (Model Versions). o Mỗi phiên bản model trong Registry có thuộc tính ModelApprovalStatus. Giá trị mặc định thường là PendingManualApproval. Để deploy model ra production, trạng thái này phải được chuyển sang Approved. o Đáp án D chính xác về mặt kỹ thuật vì việc thay đổi trạng thái này có thể thực hiện thông qua AWS SDK (sử dụng API UpdateModelPackage) hoặc qua giao diện SageMaker Studio. Đây là \"trigger\" chuẩn để các pipeline CI/CD (như EventBridge + CodePipeline) bắt sự kiện và thực hiện deploy. Tại sao không chọn A (SageMaker Experiments): o SageMaker Experiments được thiết kế để theo dõi các lần chạy huấn luyện (training runs), so sánh metrics và hyperparameters giữa các thử nghiệm. Nó giúp Data Scientist chọn ra model tốt nhất nhưng không có tính năng quản lý trạng thái phê duyệt (approval status) hay cơ chế Gatekeeper để chặn deploy như Model Registry. Tại sao không chọn B (SageMaker ML Lineage Tracking): o SageMaker ML Lineage Tracking dùng để truy vết nguồn gốc (lineage) của dữ liệu và model (ví dụ: Model A được train từ Dataset B bởi User C). Nó là công cụ để audit (kiểm toán) lịch sử, không phải là công cụ để thực thi workflow phê duyệt (operational workflow). Việc tạo \"tracking entities\" không thay đổi được trạng thái logic để cho phép deploy. Tại sao không chọn C (SageMaker Model Monitor): o SageMaker Model Monitor là dịch vụ giám sát model sau khi đã deploy (theo dõi Data Drift, Model Quality Drift). Nó hoạt động ở giai đoạn vận hành (Operation), không tham gia vào quy trình phê duyệt model (Registration & Approval) trước khi deploy."

    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn A (SageMaker Clarify & Lambda): o Giải quyết vấn đề \"Bias Drift\": Trong hệ sinh thái AWS, SageMaker Clarify là công cụ chuyên biệt để phát hiện các loại thiên kiến (bias) trong dữ liệu và mô hình (cả trước và sau khi huấn luyện). Nó có thể tính toán các chỉ số bias (như Class Imbalance, Difference in Proportions, v.v.) dựa trên dữ liệu thực tế thu thập từ endpoint. o Giải quyết vấn đề \"On-demand Workflow\": Đề bài yêu cầu quy trình chạy \"theo yêu cầu\" (on-demand) từ ứng dụng web, chứ không phải chạy theo lịch trình cố định (scheduled). AWS Lambda là giải pháp hoàn hảo để làm cầu nối: Ứng dụng gọi Lambda -> Lambda gọi API CreateProcessingJob để khởi chạy SageMaker Clarify job. Tại sao không chọn B (sagemaker-model-monitor-analyzer image): o Hình ảnh container sagemaker-model-monitor-analyzer chủ yếu được sử dụng bởi SageMaker Model Monitor để giám sát Data Quality (chất lượng dữ liệu) và Model Quality (độ chính xác, ví dụ: RMSE, Accuracy). o Đối với Bias Drift, SageMaker Model Monitor thực tế sử dụng container của Clarify bên dưới. Quan trọng hơn, hành động \"pull image\" (tải image về) không giải quyết được vấn đề; bạn cần phải chạy một job xử lý (Processing Job) với image đó, chứ không chỉ đơn thuần là tải nó về. Tại sao không chọn C (AWS Glue Data Quality): o AWS Glue Data Quality được thiết kế để kiểm tra chất lượng dữ liệu trong các pipeline ETL (ví dụ: kiểm tra null, định dạng dữ liệu trong S3 hoặc Glue Data Catalog). Nó không có khả năng phân tích các đặc tính chuyên sâu của ML Model như Bias (sự thiên vị của thuật toán) hay Model Drift. Tại sao không chọn D (SageMaker notebooks): o SageMaker Notebooks là môi trường phát triển tương tác (Interactive Development) dành cho Data Scientist để thử nghiệm code. Nó không phải là một giải pháp vận hành (Operational Solution) để tích hợp vào ứng dụng web chạy tự động. Bạn không thể dùng Notebook để đáp ứng yêu cầu \"on- demand workflow\" cho production một cách ổn định và tự động hóa."

    "explanation": "Bước 1: Use AWS Glue crawlers to infer the schemas and available columns. o Lý do chọn: Dữ liệu đầu vào là CSV thô, thiếu nhãn cột (columns are not labeled) và không đồng nhất. Để xử lý, hệ thống cần hiểu cấu trúc dữ liệu (metadata/schema). AWS Glue Crawler là dịch vụ chuyên dụng để quét S3, tự động nhận diện định dạng, suy luận schema và tạo bảng trong AWS Glue Data Catalog. Đây là bước tiền đề để các công cụ khác (như DataBrew) có thể hiểu dữ liệu đầu vào. o Tại sao không dùng Amazon Athena: Athena dùng để truy vấn dữ liệu bằng SQL dựa trên schema đã có (thường do Glue Crawler tạo ra). Athena không phải là công cụ tối ưu để \"infer schema\" và lưu trữ metadata cho quy trình ETL. Bước 2: Use AWS Glue DataBrew for data cleaning and feature engineering. o Lý do chọn: Đề bài mô tả dữ liệu rất \"bẩn\" (missing rows, missing columns, unlabelled). AWS Glue DataBrew là công cụ visual data preparation (no-code), cho phép người dùng nhìn thấy trực quan dữ liệu, dễ dàng thực hiện các thao tác như làm sạch (cleaning), điền giá trị thiếu (imputation), và gắn nhãn cột mà không cần viết code phức tạp. o Tại sao không dùng SageMaker Batch Transform: Batch Transform dùng để chạy suy luận (inference) trên hàng loạt dữ liệu bằng một model đã được huấn luyện. Nó không dùng để làm sạch dữ liệu thô ban đầu. Bước 3: Store the resulting data back in Amazon S3. o Lý do chọn: Sau khi dữ liệu đã được làm sạch và chuẩn hóa (Prepared Data), nó cần được lưu trữ lại vào một vị trí bền vững để SageMaker có thể truy cập cho việc Training. Amazon S3 là nơi lưu trữ tiêu chuẩn cho dữ liệu huấn luyện ML."

    "answer": "1,2,3",
    "explanation": "Bước 1: An S3 event notification invokes the pipeline when new data is uploaded. o Tại sao chọn: Để tự động hóa quy trình khi có \"new training data\", chúng ta cần một cơ chế Trigger (kích hoạt). AWS CodePipeline hỗ trợ trực tiếp S3 Source Action. Khi có object mới được upload (PutObject), S3 sẽ gửi event notification (thông qua EventBridge hoặc trực tiếp) để khởi động Pipeline. o Tại sao không chọn S3 Lifecycle rule: S3 Lifecycle chỉ dùng để quản lý vòng đời lưu trữ (ví dụ: chuyển sang Glacier sau 30 ngày, xóa sau 1 năm), hoàn toàn không có chức năng trigger CI/CD pipeline. Bước 2: SageMaker retrains the model by using the data in the S3 bucket. o Tại sao chọn: Mục đích của việc upload dữ liệu mới là để cập nhật model. Do đó, bước logic tiếp theo sau khi pipeline chạy là phải gọi SageMaker Training Job để huấn luyện lại (Retrain) model trên dữ liệu mới đó. Bước 3: The pipeline deploys the model to a SageMaker endpoint. o Tại sao chọn: Đề bài nêu rõ mục tiêu là \"host an ML model\" và \"deploy the model\". Để model có thể phục vụ suy luận (inference), nó phải được deploy ra một SageMaker Endpoint (Real-time hoặc Serverless). Đây là đích đến cuối cùng của quy trình CD (Continuous Delivery). o Tại sao không chọn Model Registry: Mặc dù Model Registry là một bước quan trọng trong MLOps (để quản lý phiên bản), nhưng việc đưa model vào Registry chỉ là \"lưu trữ/đăng ký\" (Register), chưa phải là \"triển khai để chạy\" (Deploy/Host). Vì đề bài yêu cầu chỉ chọn 3 bước để hoàn thành việc \"host\", nên Endpoint là đáp án chính xác hơn để thỏa mãn yêu cầu kinh doanh."

    "options": [],
    "answer": "?",
    "explanation": "1. City (Name) → One-hot encoding: o Tại sao: \"City\" là dữ liệu định danh (Categorical/Nominal data) không có thứ tự tự nhiên (ví dụ: Hà Nội không lớn hơn hay nhỏ hơn TP.HCM về mặt số học). Để đưa vào mô hình ML, ta không thể dùng Label Encoding (gán 1, 2, 3...) vì sẽ tạo ra thứ tự giả tạo. One-hot encoding là kỹ thuật chuẩn để biến mỗi thành phố thành một vector nhị phân (0/1), giúp mô hình đối xử bình đẳng với các thành phố. 2. Type_Year → Feature splitting: o Tại sao: Đây là một thuộc tính ghép (Composite Feature) chứa hai thông tin hoàn toàn khác nhau: \"Loại nhà\" (Categorical) và \"Năm xây dựng\" (Numerical/Time). Để mô hình học hiệu quả, chúng ta cần tách (Split) chuỗi này ra thành hai cột riêng biệt. Sau đó mới xử lý tiếp (ví dụ: Type thì One-hot, Year thì tính tuổi nhà). 3. Size of the building → Standardized distribution: o Tại sao: Diện tích nhà là biến số liên tục (Numerical Continuous). Trong các thuật toán hồi quy (Regression) để dự đoán giá nhà, việc các biến số có đơn vị khác nhau (ví dụ: diện tích là hàng ngàn m2, trong khi số phòng ngủ chỉ là 1-5) sẽ làm mô hình khó hội tụ. Standardized distribution (chuẩn hóa Z- score về Mean=0, Std=1) giúp đưa dữ liệu về cùng một tỷ lệ. o Tại sao không chọn Logarithmic transformation: Mặc dù Log transform thường dùng cho diện tích (do phân phối lệch phải), nhưng đề bài có từ khóa quan trọng: \"similarly sized homes\" (các ngôi nhà có kích thước tương đồng). Điều này ám chỉ dữ liệu diện tích không bị lệch quá nhiều (skewness thấp), nên việc chuẩn hóa (Standardization) là ưu tiên hợp lý hơn để cải thiện tốc độ huấn luyện."

Để giải quyết vấn đề này nhằm giúp thuật toán nắm bắt được pattern, kỹ sư ML cần thực hiện Feature Engineering (Kỹ thuật đặc trưng) và Data Transformation phức tạp (như SMOTE để cân bằng lớp, hoặc Join các bảng để tạo đặc trưng tổng hợp). Apache Spark trên Amazon EMR là công cụ xử lý dữ liệu phân tán (Distributed Processing) tiêu chuẩn, hỗ trợ các connector để đọc dữ liệu từ nhiều nguồn khác nhau (S3, JDBC cho MySQL) và thực hiện các phép tính toán JOIN, GROUP BY quy mô lớn để \"aggregate\" (tổng hợp) dữ liệu thành một tập training set sạch.

Tại sao không chọn A (Amazon Athena): Athena là dịch vụ truy vấn tương tác (Interactive Query Service) sử dụng SQL để truy vấn dữ liệu trên S3.5 Mặc dù bạn có thể viết câu lệnh SQL để tìm các giá trị ngoại lai, nhưng nó không có tính năng \"tự động phát hiện bất thường\" dành cho ML (như Isolation Forest hay thống kê phân phối tự động). Hơn nữa, Athena không có khả năng trực quan hóa dữ liệu (visualization) tích hợp sẵn mà bắt buộc phải kết nối với Amazon QuickSight, làm tăng độ phức tạp so với yêu cầu.

Tại sao không chọn A (AWS Glue + Categorical to Numerical): Mặc dù AWS Glue có thể thực hiện việc này, nhưng Glue được thiết kế thiên về các tác vụ ETL kỹ thuật dữ liệu quy mô lớn (Data Engineering). Việc thiết lập Glue Job, viết script (PySpark/Python), và debug thường tốn nhiều công sức vận hành hơn so với trải nghiệm \"click-and-config\" chuyên biệt cho ML của Data Wrangler. Tại sao không chọn B (AWS Glue + Numerical to Categorical): Đây là hướng xử lý sai về mặt khoa học dữ liệu. Thông thường, chúng ta cần biến dữ liệu chữ thành số để máy học, chứ không phải biến dữ liệu số (đang có giá trị định lượng) thành dữ liệu phân loại (trừ các trường hợp binning rất cụ thể). Việc này sẽ làm mất mát thông tin quan trọng.

SageMaker Data Wrangler cung cấp sẵn một phép biến đổi (transform) tên là \"Balance Data\". Tính năng này cho phép người dùng thực hiện Oversample (nhân bản lớp thiểu số), Undersample (giảm lớp đa số) hoặc sử dụng thuật toán SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) chỉ bằng vài cú nhấp chuột trên giao diện đồ họa. Đây là giải pháp chuyên biệt cho ML Prep và không yêu cầu viết code. Tại sao không chọn A (Amazon Athena): Athena dùng để truy vấn và phân tích dữ liệu bằng SQL. Mặc dù bạn có thể dùng SQL để lọc và trích xuất dữ liệu nhằm cân bằng thủ công, nhưng nó không có chức năng \"tự động cân bằng\" (như SMOTE). Việc phải viết query phức tạp để điều chỉnh dataset đòi hỏi nỗ lực vận hành cao hơn nhiều so với công cụ GUI có sẵn của Data Wrangler. Tại sao không chọn B (Amazon SageMaker Studio Classic built-in algorithms): Các thuật toán tích hợp sẵn (built-in algorithms) của SageMaker (như XGBoost, Linear Learner) thường có tham số để xử lý trọng số lớp (class weights), nhưng đó là cấu hình trong quá trình huấn luyện (training phase).

Giải quyết \"Class Imbalance\": LightGBM cực kỳ mạnh mẽ trong việc xử lý dữ liệu mất cân bằng (class imbalance) thông qua tham số scale_pos_weight hoặc tính năng weighted loss tự động, điều mà bài toán phát hiện gian lận (fraud detection) luôn gặp phải. . Giải quyết \"Interdependencies\": Đề bài nhấn mạnh dữ liệu có sự phụ thuộc lẫn nhau giữa các tính năng (feature interdependencies) và thuật toán hiện tại không nắm bắt được các mẫu (patterns). LightGBM là thuật toán dựa trên cây quyết định (Decision Tree-based Gradient Boosting), nó tự động nắm bắt được các mối quan hệ phi tuyến tính (non-linear) và tương tác phức tạp giữa các tính năng tốt hơn nhiều so với các mô hình tuyến tính. Tại sao không chọn B (Linear learner): Mặc dù Linear Learner là một thuật toán built-in và có thể xử lý binary classification, nhưng nó hoạt động dựa trên giả định về mối quan hệ tuyến tính (linear relationship) giữa đầu vào và đầu ra. Đề bài nói rõ rằng thuật toán hiện tại không nắm bắt được các mẫu tiềm ẩn và các tính năng có sự phụ thuộc lẫn nhau (điều thường tạo ra ranh giới quyết định phi tuyến tính). Linear Learner sẽ gặp khó khăn lớn (underfitting) với loại dữ liệu phức tạp này so với các thuật toán Tree-based như LightGBM hay XGBoost.

    "question": "A company has deployed an XGBoost prediction model in production to predict if a customer is likely to cancel a subscription. The company uses Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor to detect deviations in the F1 score. During a baseline analysis of model quality, the company recorded a threshold for the F1 score. After several months of no change, the model's F1 score decreases significantly. What could be the reason for the reduced F1 score?",

      }
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn A (Concept drift): \"Concept drift\" (Trôi dạt khái niệm) xảy ra khi mối quan hệ thống kê giữa các tính năng đầu vào (features) và biến mục tiêu (target label) thay đổi theo thời gian. Trong bài toán dự đoán hủy đăng ký (churn), hành vi khách hàng thay đổi theo thời gian (ví dụ: do xu hướng thị trường mới, đối thủ cạnh tranh mới) khiến các mẫu (patterns) mà mô hình đã học trước đây không còn đúng nữa. Đặc điểm nhận dạng chính trong đề bài là mô hình hoạt động ổn định trong vài tháng (\"after several months of no change\") rồi mới bị suy giảm chỉ số F1. Đây là dấu hiệu kinh điển của việc mô hình bị lỗi thời do Concept Drift. Tại sao không chọn B (Model complexity): Nếu mô hình không đủ phức tạp (underfitting), hiệu suất (F1 score) sẽ thấp ngay từ giai đoạn huấn luyện và triển khai ban đầu (Day 1). Nó sẽ không thể duy trì ổn định trong vài tháng rồi mới giảm đột ngột như mô tả. Tại sao không chọn C (Data quality issue in baseline): Các vấn đề về chất lượng dữ liệu trong tập baseline (như thiếu giá trị) sẽ ảnh hưởng đến chất lượng mô hình hoặc chỉ số baseline ngay từ đầu. Nó không giải thích được nguyên nhân tại sao hiệu suất lại suy giảm sau một khoảng thời gian dài vận hành ổn định. Tại sao không chọn D (Incorrect ground truth labels in baseline): Nếu nhãn thực tế (ground truth) bị sai trong quá trình tính toán baseline, thì chỉ số F1 của baseline sẽ bị tính sai ngay từ thời điểm đó. Điều này dẫn đến việc thiết lập ngưỡng (threshold) sai, nhưng nó là một lỗi tĩnh (static error). Nó không giải thích được hiện tượng \"suy giảm\" (degradation) diễn ra theo thời gian thực của mô hình hiện tại."

    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn A (Single IAM Role): SageMaker Notebook Instance hoạt động dựa trên cơ chế IAM Execution Role để tương tác với các dịch vụ khác (như S3, Glue, Athena). Bằng cách tạo một IAM Role chung chứa tất cả quyền cần thiết và gán Role này cho tất cả các Notebook Instance của nhóm, bạn đạt được mục tiêu \"centralize management\" (quản lý tập trung). Khi cần thêm hoặc bớt quyền, bạn chỉ cần sửa Policy của Role duy nhất này một lần, thay vì phải sửa từng Role riêng lẻ của từng Notebook. Tại sao không chọn B (IAM Group): IAM Group được thiết kế để quản lý quyền cho IAM Users (con người), KHÔNG phải cho tài nguyên AWS (AWS Resources). Bạn không thể gán một IAM Group trực tiếp cho một SageMaker Notebook Instance. Tài nguyên AWS phải sử dụng IAM Role. Tại sao không chọn C (IAM User & AdministratorAccess): Thứ nhất, về mặt kỹ thuật, Notebook Instance sử dụng IAM Role, không sử dụng IAM User để chạy (service assumption). Thứ hai, việc gán quyền AdministratorAccess (toàn quyền quản trị) vi phạm nghiêm trọng nguyên tắc bảo mật \"Least Privilege\" (Quyền tối thiểu), gây rủi ro an ninh lớn nếu Notebook bị xâm nhập. Tại sao không chọn D (Complex setup & IAM Group): Tương tự như đáp án B, bạn không thể gán IAM Group cho Notebook Instance. Ngoài ra, giải pháp này quá phức tạp và cũng vi phạm nguyên tắc \"Least Privilege\" khi sử dụng AdministratorAccess."

    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn D (Mean absolute error - MAE): Bài toán yêu cầu dự đoán giá căn hộ (price of apartments). Giá tiền là một biến số liên tục (continuous variable), do đó đây là bài toán Hồi quy (Regression). Trong Machine Learning, các chỉ số dùng để đánh giá mô hình Hồi quy bao gồm MAE (Sai số tuyệt đối trung bình), MSE (Sai số bình phương trung bình), và RMSE (Căn bậc hai của MSE). MAE đo lường mức độ sai lệch trung bình giữa giá trị dự đoán và giá trị thực tế, rất phù hợp để đánh giá độ chính xác của dự đoán giá. Tại sao không chọn A (Accuracy): Accuracy (Độ chính xác) là tỷ lệ số lần dự đoán đúng trên tổng số lần dự đoán. Chỉ số này chỉ dùng cho bài toán Phân loại (Classification) (ví dụ: Căn hộ này có bán được không? - Có/Không). Nó không có ý nghĩa đối với dữ liệu liên tục như giá tiền. Tại sao không chọn B (Area Under the ROC Curve - AUC): AUC là diện tích dưới đường cong ROC, được sử dụng để đánh giá hiệu suất của mô hình Phân loại nhị phân (Binary Classification) tại các ngưỡng phân loại khác nhau. Nó hoàn toàn không áp dụng cho bài toán Hồi quy. Tại sao không chọn C (F1 score): F1 score là trung bình điều hòa (harmonic mean) giữa Precision (Độ chính xác) và Recall (Độ nhạy).

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn D (Decrease the learning rate): Hiện tượng giá trị hàm mất mát (loss function) không giảm dần mà có biểu hiện \"oscillating pattern\" (dao động lên xuống) và duy trì ở mức cao là dấu hiệu kinh điển của việc Learning Rate (tốc độ học) quá cao. Trong thuật toán Gradient Descent, nếu bước nhảy (learning rate) quá lớn, thuật toán sẽ \"nhảy qua\" (overshoot) điểm cực tiểu (minima) thay vì trượt xuống đáy của nó. Nó sẽ liên tục nhảy qua lại giữa hai sườn dốc của hàm mất mát, gây ra hiện tượng dao động. Việc giảm Learning Rate sẽ thu nhỏ bước nhảy, giúp thuật toán đi xuống từ từ và hội tụ chính xác vào điểm cực tiểu. Tại sao không chọn A (Introduce early stopping): Early Stopping là kỹ thuật dùng để chống Overfitting (khi Training Loss giảm nhưng Validation Loss bắt đầu tăng).1 Trong trường hợp này, cả hai loss đều cao và dao động (nghĩa là mô hình chưa học được hoặc không hội tụ - underfitting/non-convergence), nên việc dừng sớm sẽ chỉ khiến bạn nhận được một mô hình kém chất lượng, không giải quyết được nguyên nhân gốc rễ là mô hình không thể hội tụ. Tại sao không chọn B (Increase the size of the test set): Tập Test (Test set) chỉ dùng để đánh giá hiệu năng mô hình sau khi huấn luyện xong. Kích thước của tập Test hoàn toàn không tham gia vào quá trình tính toán Gradient hay cập nhật trọng số (weights) trong quá trình huấn luyện, do đó không thể sửa chữa lỗi dao động của hàm loss. Tại sao không chọn C (Increase the learning rate): Nếu Learning Rate hiện tại đã gây ra dao động (do quá cao), việc tăng nó thêm nữa sẽ làm bước nhảy càng lớn hơn. Điều này sẽ khiến dao động mạnh hơn hoặc làm mô hình phân kỳ hoàn toàn (Divergence - Loss tăng vọt lên vô cực), làm tình hình tồi tệ hơn."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn A (Amazon Athena CTAS): . Serverless & SQL: Amazon Athena là dịch vụ truy vấn tương tác không máy chủ (Serverless), cho phép dùng chuẩn SQL để truy vấn trực tiếp dữ liệu nằm trên S3 mà không cần thiết lập hạ tầng (Least operational overhead). . Tối ưu hóa với CTAS: Câu lệnh CREATE TABLE AS SELECT (CTAS) trong Athena không chỉ tạo bảng mà còn có thể dùng để chuyển đổi định dạng dữ liệu (ví dụ: từ CSV sang Parquet) và phân vùng (partition) dữ liệu theo cột transaction_date. Việc này giúp các truy vấn sau này chỉ quét đúng phân vùng ngày tháng cần thiết, tăng tốc độ và giảm chi phí đáng kể so với việc quét toàn bộ file CSV thô. Tại sao không chọn B (S3 Object Lambda): S3 Object Lambda được thiết kế để sửa đổi nội dung của một đối tượng riêng lẻ trong khi nó đang được truy xuất (ví dụ: làm mờ dữ liệu nhạy cảm khi người dùng tải file về). Nó không phải là một công cụ truy vấn phân tích (Analytical Query Engine) để lọc và tổng hợp dữ liệu từ hàng ngàn file dựa trên một cột cụ thể. Tại sao không chọn C (AWS Glue for Apache Spark): Mặc dù Glue có thể làm được việc này, nhưng Glue là một dịch vụ ETL (Trích xuất, Chuyển đổi, Tải) yêu cầu viết code (Python/Scala) hoặc thiết lập Job phức tạp hơn. So với việc chỉ viết một câu lệnh SQL trong Athena, Glue có \"operational overhead\" (gánh nặng vận hành) cao hơn. Tại sao không chọn D (Amazon Data Firehose): Amazon Data Firehose là dịch vụ Ingestion (nạp dữ liệu) dùng để nhận luồng dữ liệu và lưu vào S3/Redshift. Nó không hỗ trợ việc đọc dữ liệu đã tồn tại (existing objects) trong S3 bucket làm nguồn (Source). Do đó, giải pháp này không khả thi về mặt kỹ thuật cho dữ liệu cũ."

    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn D (AWS Glue FindMatches): . Tính năng chuyên biệt (Purpose-built): FindMatches là một tính năng Machine Learning chuyển đổi (ML Transform) tích hợp sẵn trong AWS Glue. Nó được thiết kế đặc biệt để giải quyết bài toán \"Record Linkage\" hoặc \"Entity Resolution\" (liên kết bản ghi), cho phép tìm các bản ghi trùng lặp ngay cả khi chúng không khớp chính xác từng ký tự (fuzzy matching - ví dụ: \"Jon Smith\" và \"John Smith\"). . Least code development (Ít code nhất): Bạn không cần viết mã thuật toán ML. Thay vào đó, bạn dạy hệ thống bằng cách gán nhãn thủ công một tập nhỏ các cặp bản ghi là \"trùng\" hoặc \"không trùng\". Glue sẽ tự động học và áp dụng logic đó cho toàn bộ tập dữ liệu lớn. Đây là giải pháp \"Zero-code\" về mặt thuật toán. Tại sao không chọn A (Amazon Mechanical Turk): Mechanical Turk là dịch vụ sử dụng sức người (crowdsourcing) để thực hiện các tác vụ. Mặc dù con người rất giỏi phát hiện trùng lặp trong dữ liệu phi cấu trúc, nhưng giải pháp này không thể mở rộng (scale) cho \"large dataset\" một cách hiệu quả về thời gian và chi phí.

    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn A (Spot Instances): Đây là lựa chọn tối ưu nhất về chi phí (có thể rẻ hơn tới 90% so với giá On-Demand). Chìa khóa của câu hỏi nằm ở cụm từ \"The processing can handle interruptions\" (Quy trình có thể xử lý việc bị gián đoạn). Spot Instances là phần dung lượng dư thừa của AWS, giá rất rẻ nhưng có thể bị AWS thu hồi (interruption) bất cứ lúc nào với cảnh báo trước 2 phút. Vì ứng dụng chịu được lỗi này, đây là lựa chọn hoàn hảo. Tại sao không chọn B (Reserved Instances): Reserved Instances (RI) yêu cầu cam kết sử dụng lâu dài (1 hoặc 3 năm) và thường dành cho các tác vụ chạy liên tục 24/7 (steady-state usage). Việc mua RI cho một job chỉ chạy 90 phút mỗi tuần là cực kỳ lãng phí vì bạn phải trả tiền cho cả thời gian không sử dụng. Tại sao không chọn C (On-Demand Instances): On-Demand Instances là lựa chọn tiêu chuẩn, trả tiền theo giờ/giây sử dụng và không bị gián đoạn. Tuy nhiên, mức giá của nó cao hơn nhiều so với Spot Instances. Vì đề bài yêu cầu \"Most cost-effectively\" và job chịu được gián đoạn, nên việc trả giá cao cho sự ổn định của On-Demand là không cần thiết.

Quy trình chuẩn bao gồm: . Tại Account A (Source): Cấu hình Resource-based IAM policy trên Model (hoặc KMS key nếu model được mã hóa) để cho phép Account B truy cập. . Tại Account B (Target): Gọi lệnh ImportModel và trỏ tới ARN của model gốc ở Account A. Đây là giải pháp chính thống, ít tốn công sức lập trình nhất vì AWS xử lý toàn bộ quy trình sao chép ở backend. Tại sao không chọn A (Amazon S3 copy): Một Amazon Comprehend Custom Model không chỉ đơn thuần là các file artifacts nằm trên S3. Nó là một tài nguyên được quản lý (managed resource) bao gồm metadata, cấu hình huấn luyện và endpoint. Việc chỉ sao chép file vật lý từ S3 bucket của Account A sang Account B sẽ không tạo ra một đối tượng \"Model\" hoạt động được trong giao diện điều khiển (Console) hay API của Account B.

Tại sao không chọn C (AWS DataSync): AWS DataSync là dịch vụ chuyên dùng để di chuyển lượng dữ liệu lớn giữa các hệ thống lưu trữ (như từ On-premises NAS lên S3, hoặc giữa các EFS). Nó hoạt động ở cấp độ file/object storage, không hiểu ngữ nghĩa của một \"Machine Learning Model\". Nó không thể dùng để đăng ký hay import model vào dịch vụ Comprehend. Tại sao không chọn D (AWS Site-to-Site VPN): Site-to-Site VPN được dùng để kết nối mạng giữa trung tâm dữ liệu tại chỗ (On-premises) và AWS VPC. Việc kết nối giữa hai tài khoản AWS (Account A và Account B) nằm trong cùng một Region hoàn toàn không cần đến VPN; chúng giao tiếp qua mạng backbone của AWS hoặc VPC Peering/Transit Gateway.

Khi model bắt đầu học thuộc lòng các nhiễu (noise) của tập train thay vì học quy luật chung, lỗi trên tập validation sẽ tăng lên. Early Stopping là kỹ thuật giám sát chỉ số trên tập validation và tự động dừng quá trình huấn luyện ngay khi hiệu suất bắt đầu có dấu hiệu suy giảm, ngăn chặn việc model bị Overfitting. Tại sao chọn B (Increase dropout): Dropout là một kỹ thuật điều chuẩn (Regularization) mạnh mẽ cho mạng nơ-ron. Bằng cách ngẫu nhiên \"tắt\" một số nơ- ron trong quá trình huấn luyện, Dropout buộc mạng phải học các đặc trưng mạnh mẽ hơn (robust features) và không phụ thuộc quá nhiều vào bất kỳ nơ-ron đơn lẻ nào. Việc tăng tỷ lệ Dropout giúp giảm độ phức tạp thực tế của mô hình, từ đó giảm thiểu Overfitting. Tại sao không chọn C (Increase the number of layers): Tăng số lượng lớp (làm model sâu hơn) đồng nghĩa với việc tăng độ phức tạp và khả năng ghi nhớ (capacity) của mô hình. Một mô hình càng phức tạp thì càng dễ bị Overfitting. Hành động này sẽ làm tình trạng tồi tệ hơn. Tại sao không chọn D (Increase the number of neurons): Tương tự như đáp án C, việc tăng số lượng nơ-ron (làm model rộng hơn) cũng làm tăng khả năng ghi nhớ của mô hình, dẫn đến nguy cơ Overfitting cao hơn. Tại sao không chọn E (Reduce model bias): Khái niệm \"Bias\" cao thường liên quan đến Underfitting (mô hình quá đơn giản, không học được gì). Trong tình huống này, mô hình đã học được (hiệu suất cải thiện ban đầu) nhưng sau đó học quá kỹ dẫn đến sai trên tập mới (High Variance). Do đó, vấn đề là Variance, không phải Bias."

Để làm được điều này với SQL, bạn cần các cơ sở dữ liệu hỗ trợ vector extension (như PostgreSQL với pgvector), điều mà Glue không cung cấp. Tại sao không chọn B (SageMaker Feature Store & SQL): SageMaker Feature Store được thiết kế để lưu trữ và phục vụ các tính năng (features) cho mô hình ML với độ trễ thấp (cho inference) hoặc dùng lại cho training. Mặc dù nó có hỗ trợ lưu vector, nhưng nó không phải là một công cụ tìm kiếm (Search Engine). Bạn không thể thực hiện truy vấn tìm kiếm ngữ nghĩa linh hoạt trên Feature Store bằng các câu lệnh SQL đơn thuần. Tại sao không chọn D (Amazon Textract): Amazon Textract là dịch vụ OCR (Optical Character Recognition) dùng để trích xuất văn bản từ hình ảnh hoặc file PDF scan. Nó là công cụ \"tiền xử lý\" (preprocessing). Textract không có khả năng lưu trữ chỉ mục hay cung cấp API để thực hiện tìm kiếm ngữ nghĩa trên tập dữ liệu đã trích xuất."

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn D (One-hot encode): \"Color scheme\" (bảng màu) là dữ liệu danh mục định danh (Nominal Categorical Data), nghĩa là các màu sắc như Đỏ, Xanh, Vàng ngang hàng nhau, không có thứ tự hơn kém (Đỏ không \"lớn hơn\" hay \"nhỏ hơn\" Xanh). One-hot encoding biến mỗi giá trị màu thành một vector nhị phân riêng biệt (ví dụ: Đỏ = [1, 0, 0], Xanh = [0, 1, 0]). Điều này giúp Mạng Nơ-ron (Neural Network) xử lý từng màu sắc như một tín hiệu độc lập mà không vô tình học sai các mối quan hệ số học (như 1 < 2 < 3) không tồn tại. Tại sao không chọn A (Label encoding): Label encoding gán mỗi màu một số nguyên (ví dụ: Đỏ=1, Xanh=2, Vàng=3). Mạng Nơ-ron sẽ hiểu nhầm rằng Vàng (3) có giá trị \"lớn hơn\" Đỏ (1) hoặc trung bình cộng của Đỏ và Vàng là Xanh. Điều này sai hoàn toàn về mặt bản chất dữ liệu màu sắc và sẽ làm mô hình học sai lệch. Label encoding chỉ nên dùng cho dữ liệu danh mục có thứ tự (Ordinal Data - ví dụ: Kém, Trung bình, Giỏi). Tại sao không chọn B (Implement padding): Padding là kỹ thuật thêm giá trị (thường là 0) để làm đồng đều độ dài của các chuỗi dữ liệu (sequence length), thường dùng trong xử lý ngôn ngữ tự nhiên (NLP) hoặc chuỗi thời gian. Nó không dùng để mã hóa một biến danh mục đơn lẻ như màu sắc. Tại sao không chọn C (Dimensionality reduction): Dimensionality reduction (như PCA) dùng để giảm số lượng chiều dữ liệu khi chúng quá lớn hoặc bị dư thừa. Trong khi đó, biến màu sắc đang ở dạng thô (text/category), cần được mã hóa thành số trước khi có thể áp dụng bất kỳ thuật toán toán học nào. Hơn nữa, One- hot encoding thực tế làm tăng số chiều dữ liệu, ngược lại với giảm chiều."

Đề bài nêu rõ dữ liệu nằm trong S3, đây là trường hợp sử dụng chính (primary use case) của Macie. o Tối ưu vận hành (Least Operational Overhead): Macie tự động hóa việc quét (scan) mà không cần người dùng xây dựng mô hình hay logic phát hiện. Kết hợp với AWS Lambda (serverless) để thực thi hành động \"remove\" (xóa hoặc che/redact) dựa trên các phát hiện (findings) của Macie giúp loại bỏ gánh nặng quản lý máy chủ. Đây là kiến trúc Event-driven (Macie $\\rightarrow$ EventBridge $\\rightarrow$ Lambda) chuẩn mực và ít tốn công sức quản trị nhất.

Nó hỗ trợ trực quan hóa, tạo các \"Model deployment pipelines\" thông qua SageMaker Projects và MLOps template, đáp ứng chính xác yêu cầu thứ hai. Tại sao không chọn A (Amazon Data Firehose): o Sai trường hợp sử dụng (Use Case Mismatch): Amazon Data Firehose là dịch vụ để nạp dữ liệu streaming (thời gian thực) vào các đích đến (như S3, Redshift). Trong bài toán này, dữ liệu đã nằm sẵn ở dạng tĩnh trong S3 (batch data), việc dùng Firehose để xử lý dữ liệu đã lưu trữ là không phù hợp. Firehose thường là bước trước khi dữ liệu vào S3.

Khi bạn thêm một Model Group vào một Collection, bản thân Model Group đó không bị thay đổi, không bị di chuyển vật lý, và các artifact trong S3/ECR vẫn giữ nguyên. Nó chỉ tạo ra một lớp tham chiếu logic bên trên. Tại sao không chọn A (Custom Tags): o Khả năng mở rộng kém hơn (Scalability & Hierarchy): Mặc dù Tags có thể dùng để lọc (filter), nhưng chúng chỉ là metadata phẳng (flat metadata). Khi đề bài nhắc đến việc \"organize... into groups\" cho hàng trăm data scientists với các danh mục rõ ràng, việc sử dụng cấu trúc phân cấp (Hierarchy) của Collections sẽ quản lý tốt hơn và chuyên nghiệp hơn so với việc chỉ dựa vào tag tìm kiếm.

Tại sao không chọn B (SageMaker Endpoint + Lambda): o Gánh nặng tích hợp (High Integration Overhead): Việc sử dụng Lambda để gọi SageMaker Endpoint cho hàng nghìn bản ghi mỗi giây là không hiệu quả về mặt kiến trúc. Nó tạo ra độ trễ (latency) mạng không cần thiết và chi phí cao do số lượng invocations quá lớn. Ngoài ra, bạn phải quản lý vòng đời của model trong SageMaker (train, deploy, monitor). Tại sao không chọn C (Kafka on EC2): o Gánh nặng quản trị hạ tầng (Extreme Operational Overhead): Cụm từ \"Apache Kafka on Amazon EC2\" là dấu hiệu nhận biết của gánh nặng vận hành lớn nhất. Bạn phải tự cài đặt, cấu hình, vá lỗi, và mở rộng cụm Kafka (Brokers, Zookeeper) thay vì dùng dịch vụ serverless như Kinesis. Tại sao không chọn D (SQS + Glue): o Sai mô hình xử lý (Batch vs Streaming): AWS Glue là dịch vụ ETL hướng tới xử lý theo lô (Batch processing) với thời gian khởi động (cold start) tính bằng phút. Nó không thể đáp ứng yêu cầu xử lý dữ liệu thị trường theo thời gian thực (real-time) từng giây."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn C (Amazon Comprehend): o Dịch vụ có sẵn (Managed Service): Amazon Comprehend là dịch vụ NLP (Natural Language Processing) được AWS quản lý hoàn toàn và đã được huấn luyện trước (pre-trained). Tính năng cốt lõi của nó là Sentiment Analysis (phân tích cảm xúc: Tích cực, Tiêu cực, Trung tính, Hỗn hợp). o Tối ưu thời gian (Least amount of time): Vì mô hình đã được AWS xây dựng sẵn, kỹ sư ML chỉ cần gọi API để nhận kết quả ngay lập tức mà không cần tốn thời gian thu thập dữ liệu, gán nhãn, huấn luyện hay tinh chỉnh mô hình. Đây là giải pháp nhanh nhất (Turn-key solution). Tại sao không chọn A (Amazon Rekognition): o Sai miền dữ liệu (Wrong Domain): Amazon Rekognition là dịch vụ thị giác máy tính (Computer Vision) dùng để phân tích hình ảnh và video (nhận diện khuôn mặt, vật thể). Nó không có khả năng đọc hiểu hay phân tích cảm xúc từ văn bản (chat logs). Tại sao không chọn B (Naive Bayes classifier): o Tốn thời gian phát triển (High Development Time): Naive Bayes là một thuật toán ML cổ điển. Để sử dụng, bạn phải tự chuẩn bị dataset, làm sạch dữ liệu (cleaning), vector hóa (tokenization/vectorization), huấn luyện (training) và đánh giá mô hình. Quy trình này tốn nhiều thời gian hơn rất nhiều so với việc gọi một API có sẵn như Comprehend. Tại sao không chọn D (Random forests): o Tốn thời gian phát triển: Tương tự như đáp án B, Random Forest là một thuật toán học máy cần được huấn luyện thủ công (Custom Model). Việc xây dựng pipeline huấn luyện từ đầu vi phạm yêu cầu \"LEAST amount of time\" của đề bài."

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn D (Giảm Temperature và Giảm Top_k): o Giảm Temperature (Temperature $\\to$ 0): Tham số Temperature kiểm soát độ \"sáng tạo\" hay tính ngẫu nhiên của mô hình. Giá trị càng thấp (gần 0), mô hình càng tự tin chọn từ có xác suất cao nhất tiếp theo. Điều này làm cho câu trả lời trở nên định hướng (deterministic), nhất quán và ít ngẫu nhiên hơn. o Giảm Top_k: Tham số Top_k giới hạn số lượng các token tiềm năng được xem xét cho bước tiếp theo. Khi giảm Top_k xuống thấp (ví dụ: k=1), mô hình bị ép buộc chỉ chọn trong số rất ít các từ có khả năng cao nhất, loại bỏ các lựa chọn lạ hoặc ít gặp. o Kết hợp: Việc giảm cả hai tham số này là cách mạnh nhất để ép mô hình hoạt động như một cỗ máy chính xác, luôn trả về cùng một kết quả cho cùng một đầu vào (Consistent & Less Random). Tại sao không chọn A (Increase both): o Tăng tính ngẫu nhiên: Tăng Temperature làm phẳng phân phối xác suất (làm các từ ít khả năng cũng có cơ hội được chọn). Tăng Top_k mở rộng tập hợp các từ được chọn. Kết hợp lại sẽ tạo ra kết quả cực kỳ đa dạng, sáng tạo nhưng rất ngẫu nhiên và thiếu nhất quán, hoàn toàn trái ngược với yêu cầu đề bài. Tại sao không chọn B (Increase Temp, Decrease Top_k): o Xung đột mục tiêu: Mặc dù giảm Top_k giúp hạn chế phạm vi, nhưng việc tăng Temperature lại khuyến khích sự hỗn loạn trong phân phối xác suất. Nhiệt độ cao vẫn sẽ khiến mô hình đưa ra các câu trả lời khác nhau và ảo giác (hallucination) nhiều hơn là sự ổn định. Tại sao không chọn C (Decrease Temp, Increase Top_k): o Chưa tối ưu: Giảm Temperature là đúng hướng để tăng sự ổn định. Tuy nhiên, việc giữ Top_k ở mức cao (Increase Top_k) vẫn mở ra một cửa sổ lựa chọn lớn cho mô hình. So với đáp án D (nơi cả hai đều bị siết chặt), đáp án C vẫn có khả năng sinh ra sự biến thiên (variation) cao hơn."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn C (Increase target_precision): o Nguyên lý Precision - False Positive: Trong bài toán phân loại, Precision (Độ chính xác) được tính bằng công thức: $Precision = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP}$. Để giảm thiểu False Positives (FP - báo động giả, tức là báo có cỏ dại nhưng thực tế không có), ta buộc phải tăng Precision. o Hyperparameter của Linear Learner: Thuật toán SageMaker Linear Learner hỗ trợ hyperparameter target_precision (khi kết hợp với tiêu chí lựa chọn mô hình). Bằng cách tăng giá trị này, bạn đang ra lệnh cho thuật toán tìm kiếm ngưỡng phân loại (threshold) sao cho xác suất dự đoán đúng là cao nhất, chấp nhận việc có thể bỏ sót một số cỏ dại (giảm Recall) miễn là không báo sai. Đây là cách trực tiếp nhất để giải quyết yêu cầu \"MINIMIZE false positives\". Tại sao không chọn A (Weight decay to zero): o Sai chức năng: weight_decay (suy giảm trọng số) là kỹ thuật Regularization (chống quá khớp/overfitting) bằng cách cộng thêm hình phạt vào hàm mất mát để giữ cho trọng số nhỏ. Việc đặt nó về 0 chỉ làm tắt tính năng này, có thể khiến mô hình bị overfit, nhưng không có cơ chế trực tiếp nào để ưu tiên giảm False Positives so với False Negatives. Tại sao không chọn B (Increase training epochs): o Không giải quyết vấn đề ngưỡng: Tăng số lượng epochs chỉ giúp mô hình học lâu hơn để hội tụ về điểm cực trị của hàm mất mát (Loss function). Nó không thay đổi mục tiêu tối ưu hóa (optimization objective) từ cân bằng sang ưu tiên Precision. Mô hình có thể học tốt hơn nhưng vẫn giữ tỷ lệ FP/FN mặc định. Tại sao không chọn D (Change to regressor): o Sai loại bài toán: predictor_type='regressor' dùng cho bài toán Hồi quy (dự đoán giá trị số liên tục, ví dụ: dự đoán giá nhà, nhiệt độ). Bài toán ở đây là dự đoán sự hiện diện của cỏ dại (Có/Không hoặc Loại A/B/C), tức là bài toán Phân loại (Classification). Chuyển sang Regressor là sai hoàn toàn về mặt kỹ thuật."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn A (Zero Buffering): o Giảm độ trễ tối đa: Theo mặc định, Amazon Data Firehose sẽ gom dữ liệu (buffer) trong một khoảng thời gian (ví dụ: 60 giây) hoặc dung lượng nhất định trước khi gửi đến đích để tối ưu hiệu suất I/O. Tuy nhiên, điều này tạo ra độ trễ. Tính năng Zero Buffering (đặt khoảng thời gian buffer về 0) cho phép Firehose gửi dữ liệu đi ngay lập tức sau khi nhận được, giúp giảm độ trễ xuống mức thấp nhất có thể (gần thời gian thực), đáp ứng yêu cầu của dashboard. o Tối ưu Throughput: Việc tinh chỉnh Batch size trong PutRecordBatch giúp đảm bảo rằng dù gửi nhanh nhưng pipeline vẫn xử lý hiệu quả lượng dữ liệu đầu vào lớn mà không bị nghẽn. Tại sao không chọn B (AWS DataSync): o Sai dịch vụ: AWS DataSync là dịch vụ dùng để di chuyển dữ liệu lưu trữ khối lượng lớn (bulk data transfer) giữa các hệ thống lưu trữ (như on-premise NAS, EFS sang S3). Nó không phải là dịch vụ xử lý luồng dữ liệu (streaming ingestion) cho các giao dịch bán hàng thời gian thực từng bản ghi một. Tại sao không chọn C (Increase buffer interval): o Đi ngược mục tiêu: Tăng buffer interval từ 60s lên 120s đồng nghĩa với việc giữ dữ liệu lại lâu hơn trong ống dẫn trước khi gửi đi. Điều này làm tăng độ trễ gấp đôi, hoàn toàn trái ngược với yêu cầu \"sub-second latency\". Tại sao không chọn D (Amazon SQS): o Mất tính năng tích hợp sẵn: Amazon SQS là hàng đợi thông điệp, nó không có khả năng tự động \"ingest\" (nạp) dữ liệu vào OpenSearch. Nếu dùng SQS, bạn phải tự xây dựng thêm một lớp compute (ví dụ: Lambda hoặc EC2 worker) để đọc từ SQS và ghi vào OpenSearch.

    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn A (Real-time inference endpoint + Auto scaling): o Minimum Latency (Độ trễ tối thiểu): SageMaker Real-time inference endpoints được thiết kế chuyên biệt cho các ứng dụng yêu cầu phản hồi tức thì với độ trễ thấp (low latency), phù hợp trực tiếp với yêu cầu \"respond with minimum latency\". o Unpredictable bursts & Adapt proportionally (Xử lý đột biến & Thích ứng): Tính năng Auto Scaling của SageMaker cho phép endpoint tự động tăng giảm số lượng instance (instances count) dựa trên các metric (như InvocationsPerInstance), giúp hệ thống thích ứng linh hoạt với các đợt request tăng đột biến không thể dự đoán trước (\"unpredictable bursts\"). o Request Size: Kích thước payload từ 1 KB đến 3 MB nằm trong giới hạn hỗ trợ tốt của Real-time endpoints (hỗ trợ payload lên tới 6MB cho synchronous requests). Tại sao không chọn B (Amazon ECS + Scheduled scaling): o Scheduled scaling (Scaling theo lịch trình): Giải pháp này chỉ hoạt động hiệu quả khi bạn biết trước mô hình lưu lượng truy cập (ví dụ: traffic tăng vào 8 giờ sáng). Đề bài nhấn mạnh \"unpredictable bursts\" (đột biến không dự báo trước), do đó Scheduled scaling sẽ thất bại trong việc đáp ứng nhu cầu tức thời, gây ra độ trễ hoặc lỗi. Tại sao không chọn C (Amazon EKS + SageMaker Operator): o Overhead vận hành: Mặc dù EKS có thể chạy inference, nhưng việc thiết lập và quản lý một cluster Kubernetes chỉ để host model làm tăng độ phức tạp không cần thiết so với dịch vụ native SageMaker. o Scaling Metric (Memory): Scaling dựa trên Memory (bộ nhớ) thường không nhạy bén cho inference bằng scaling dựa trên số lượng request hoặc GPU utilization. Quan trọng hơn, giải pháp này không tối ưu hóa \"out-of-the-box\" cho latency tốt bằng SageMaker Real-time endpoint. Tại sao không chọn D (Spot Instances + Spot Fleet): o Vi phạm tính sẵn sàng (Availability): Spot Instances có thể bị AWS thu hồi bất cứ lúc nào (với cảnh báo 2 phút).

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn D (Primary/Core On-Demand + Task Spot): o Bảo vệ dữ liệu (Data Integrity): Trong kiến trúc EMR, Core nodes chịu trách nhiệm lưu trữ dữ liệu trên HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System). Nếu chạy Core nodes bằng Spot Instances và bị AWS thu hồi, bạn có nguy cơ mất dữ liệu được lưu trên đó (vi phạm yêu cầu \"Any data loss is unacceptable\"). Do đó, Core nodes bắt buộc phải dùng On-Demand (hoặc Reserved) để đảm bảo độ bền dữ liệu. o Tối ưu chi phí (Cost-effective): Task nodes chỉ thực hiện tính toán (compute) và không lưu trữ dữ liệu HDFS. Nếu một Task node bị thu hồi, tác vụ đó chỉ đơn giản là được gửi lại cho node khác xử lý mà không gây mất mát dữ liệu. Vì vậy, sử dụng Spot Instances cho Task nodes là cách an toàn nhất để giảm chi phí mà không hy sinh tính toàn vẹn dữ liệu. o Primary Node: Luôn cần ổn định để quản lý cluster, nên dùng On-Demand. Tại sao không chọn A (All On-Demand): o Không tối ưu chi phí: Chạy Task nodes bằng On-Demand là lãng phí tiền bạc vì Task nodes hoàn toàn có thể chịu lỗi (fault-tolerant) và tận dụng được giá rẻ của Spot Instances. Tại sao không chọn B (All Spot): o Rủi ro cao nhất: Nếu Primary node (Spot) bị thu hồi, toàn bộ cluster sẽ dừng hoạt động (terminate). Nếu Core nodes (Spot) bị thu hồi, dữ liệu HDFS có thể bị mất vĩnh viễn. Tại sao không chọn C (Core nodes on Spot): o Rủi ro mất dữ liệu: Như đã phân tích, Core nodes lưu trữ data. Dù HDFS có cơ chế replication, việc mất Core nodes đột ngột do Spot interruption vẫn gây rủi ro cao cho dữ liệu và tính ổn định của HDFS, vi phạm yêu cầu \"không chấp nhận mất dữ liệu\"."

Nếu nó phát hiện loss function không giảm (non-converging) hoặc các lỗi kỹ thuật (vanishing gradients), nó có thể tự động dừng job. Việc này ngăn chặn việc chạy máy trong nhiều giờ hoặc nhiều ngày vô ích, giúp tiết kiệm điện năng và tài nguyên tính toán đáng kể. Tại sao chọn D (AWS Trainium): o Tối ưu hóa phần cứng (Hardware Efficiency): AWS Trainium là dòng chip được AWS thiết kế chuyên biệt (custom silicon) cho mục đích Deep Learning training. Theo công bố của AWS, Trainium cung cấp hiệu năng trên mỗi watt (performance per watt) tốt hơn nhiều so với các instance GPU tiêu chuẩn, trực tiếp giúp giảm lượng tiêu thụ năng lượng cho cùng một khối lượng công việc training. Tại sao không chọn B (SageMaker Ground Truth): o Sai giai đoạn (Wrong Phase): Ground Truth là dịch vụ hỗ trợ gán nhãn dữ liệu (data labeling), thuộc giai đoạn chuẩn bị dữ liệu (Data Prep). Việc gán nhãn hiệu quả không tác động trực tiếp đến mức tiêu thụ điện năng của hạ tầng tính toán (compute infrastructure) khi chạy training job. Tại sao không chọn C (AWS Lambda): o Sai mục đích (Inference vs Training): AWS Lambda thường được dùng để triển khai mô hình (Inference) cho các workload nhẹ hoặc không thường xuyên. Lambda không được thiết kế và không phù hợp để chạy các training job nặng nề, kéo dài (long-running) và đòi hỏi tài nguyên GPU lớn. Tại sao không chọn E (Distributed Training): o Không đảm bảo tiết kiệm tổng năng lượng: Distributed training giúp giảm thời gian chạy thực tế (wall-clock time) nhưng thường làm tăng tổng tài nguyên tiêu thụ do chi phí giao tiếp mạng (communication overhead) và đồng bộ hóa giữa các node.

Tại sao không chọn D (AWS::SageMaker::Pipeline): Resource này dùng để định nghĩa workflow tự động hóa (MLOps pipeline) gồm các bước như xử lý dữ liệu, training, đánh giá model. Mặc dù pipeline có thể tạo ra model (thông qua bước CreateModel), nhưng bản thân resource AWS::SageMaker::Pipeline là công cụ quản lý quy trình, không phải là đối tượng model được host."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn C (Lake Formation tags): Đây là giải pháp hiệu quả nhất về mặt vận hành (Operationally Efficient) để quản lý quyền truy cập chi tiết (fine-grained access control) trong Data Lake. o Lake Formation sử dụng mô hình Tag-based Access Control (LF-Tags). Bạn có thể gán tag (ví dụ: Campaign=A) cho database, table, hoặc column, sau đó cấp quyền cho người dùng dựa trên tag này. o Khi có engineer mới hoặc campaign mới, chỉ cần update tag hoặc policy trong Lake Formation một lần duy nhất, thay vì sửa từng IAM Policy hay Bucket Policy phức tạp. o Lake Formation tự động quản lý credential tạm thời để truy cập S3 khi user query qua Athena, đảm bảo user chỉ thấy dữ liệu họ được phép thấy. Tại sao không chọn A (IAM policies on Glue Catalog): o IAM Policy quản lý quyền truy cập vào metadata trong Glue Data Catalog, nhưng nó không thể kiểm soát chi tiết quyền truy cập vào dữ liệu gốc (underlying data) nằm trong S3 một cách linh hoạt và bảo mật granular như Lake Formation (ví dụ: column-level security). o Việc viết IAM condition phức tạp cho từng campaign sẽ rất khó quản lý và bảo trì (Operational burden cao). Tại sao không chọn B (DynamoDB + Lambda + S3 Bucket Policy): o Đây là một giải pháp \"tự chế\" (custom solution) cực kỳ phức tạp và rủi ro. Bạn phải viết code Lambda, quản lý DynamoDB, và quan trọng nhất là S3 Bucket Policy có giới hạn về kích thước ký tự (policy size limit). o Khi số lượng user và campaign tăng, bucket policy sẽ nhanh chóng chạm trần giới hạn kích thước, khiến giải pháp này không thể mở rộng (not scalable). Tại sao không chọn D (S3 Bucket Policies): o Tương tự như B, S3 Bucket Policy không được thiết kế để quản lý hàng trăm user mapping với hàng trăm campaign riêng biệt. o Việc hard-code quyền truy cập vào bucket policy cho từng engineer/campaign là ác mộng vận hành (operational nightmare), dễ gây lỗi và khó audit."

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn D (Apache Parquet files): o Hiệu suất tối ưu (Minimize processing time): Apache Parquet là định dạng lưu trữ dạng cột (columnar storage format). Nó cho phép hệ thống (như SageMaker Canvas) chỉ đọc những cột dữ liệu cần thiết thay vì quét toàn bộ dòng, giúp giảm đáng kể lượng I/O và tăng tốc độ xử lý. o Hỗ trợ cấu trúc phức tạp (Complex structure): Đề bài nhắc đến dữ liệu có \"complex in structure\". Parquet hỗ trợ rất tốt các kiểu dữ liệu lồng nhau (nested data structures) một cách hiệu quả mà vẫn giữ được schema chặt chẽ. o Nén hiệu quả: Parquet thường đi kèm với thuật toán nén (như Snappy) ngay trong định dạng, giúp giảm dung lượng lưu trữ và băng thông mạng tốt hơn so với các định dạng văn bản thuần túy. Tại sao không chọn A (CSV files compressed with Snappy): o CSV là định dạng dựa trên hàng (row-based). Để truy xuất dữ liệu, hệ thống phải phân tích cú pháp (parse) từng dòng văn bản, điều này tốn nhiều CPU hơn và chậm hơn so với format binary như Parquet. o CSV xử lý các cấu trúc dữ liệu phức tạp (như mảng hoặc object lồng nhau) rất kém và thường dễ gây lỗi định dạng. Tại sao không chọn B (JSON objects in JSONL format): o Mặc dù JSONL (JSON Lines) hỗ trợ cấu trúc phức tạp tốt, nhưng nó vẫn là định dạng văn bản (text-based). Việc parse JSON tốn kém tài nguyên CPU và dung lượng file thường lớn hơn nhiều so với Parquet (do lặp lại tên trường ở mỗi bản ghi). Tại sao không chọn C (JSON files compressed with gzip): o Gzip giúp giảm dung lượng file khi truyền tải, nhưng nó là định dạng nén không thể chia nhỏ (non-splittable) một cách hiệu quả trong xử lý song song (parallel processing) như Snappy hay cấu trúc block của Parquet. o Khi cần đọc một phần dữ liệu, hệ thống vẫn phải giải nén (decompress) toàn bộ block hoặc file, gây chậm trễ trong xử lý (processing time)."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn C (CloudTrail + CloudWatch): o Record API call events: Đề bài yêu cầu \"record... all the API call events\" (ghi lại chi tiết toàn bộ sự kiện gọi API). AWS CloudTrail là dịch vụ duy nhất được thiết kế chuyên biệt để ghi nhật ký (logging/auditing) mọi hành động gọi API trong tài khoản AWS, bao gồm cả thông tin ai gọi, từ IP nào, và thời gian gọi. Đối với SageMaker Endpoint, hành động InvokeEndpoint được coi là \"Data Event\" và CloudTrail có thể ghi lại nó. o Monitor & Notify: CloudWatch Dashboard dùng để trực quan hóa dữ liệu log/metric này và CloudWatch Alarm dùng để gửi thông báo khi số lượng sự kiện vượt ngưỡng. Sự kết hợp này giải quyết trọn vẹn cả hai vế \"Record\" và \"Monitor/Notify\". Tại sao không chọn D (Invocations metric only): o Mặc dù CloudWatch Metric Invocations có thể đếm số lượng request và kích hoạt Alarm (đáp ứng vế Monitor/Notify), nhưng nó không đáp ứng được yêu cầu \"Record all the API call events\". Metric chỉ lưu trữ con số thống kê (ví dụ: có 100 calls), chứ không lưu trữ bản ghi chi tiết của từng event (log entry) để phục vụ việc kiểm tra hay audit sau này. Tại sao không chọn A (SageMaker Debugger - Custom rule): o SageMaker Debugger được thiết kế để theo dõi trạng thái nội tại của model (internal model state) trong quá trình training (như giá trị weights, gradients, loss) để tìm lỗi thuật toán. Nó không dùng để ghi nhận các sự kiện gọi API ở tầng hạ tầng (Infrastructure/API level). Tại sao không chọn B (SageMaker Debugger - tensor_variance): o Tương tự như A, rule tensor_variance dùng để phát hiện sự bất thường trong tính toán tensor của model (ví dụ: gradient vanishing/exploding), hoàn toàn không liên quan đến việc đếm hay ghi log số lần gọi API của endpoint."

    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn C (Callback steps): o Cơ chế hoạt động: CallbackStep trong Amazon SageMaker Pipelines được thiết kế đặc biệt để tích hợp các quy trình xử lý bên ngoài (external processes) vào pipeline. Khi pipeline chạy đến bước này, nó sẽ gửi một token (thường qua SQS) và chuyển sang trạng thái \"Waiting\". Một Lambda function có thể nhận token này, kích hoạt AWS Glue Workflow hiện có, và khi Glue Workflow chạy xong, Lambda sẽ gọi ngược lại API SendPipelineCallbackStepSuccess để pipeline tiếp tục. o Least Operational Overhead: Giải pháp này tận dụng lại toàn bộ logic của AWS Glue Workflow đã có sẵn (đúng như đề bài yêu cầu là công ty đã có jobs và workflow). Bạn không cần phải viết lại code xử lý dữ liệu (ETL) hay cấu hình lại hạ tầng chạy job, chỉ cần thêm một lớp keo dán (integration layer) nhỏ là xong. Tại sao không chọn A (AWS Step Functions): o Mặc dù Step Functions là công cụ điều phối (orchestrator) rất mạnh, nhưng việc chuyển đổi cả SageMaker Pipelines và AWS Glue Workflow hiện có sang một State Machine mới trong Step Functions đòi hỏi nỗ lực tái cấu trúc (re- architecting) rất lớn. Điều này vi phạm nguyên tắc \"LEAST operational overhead\". SageMaker Pipelines đã là một orchestrator chuyên dụng cho ML, không cần chồng thêm một orchestrator khác. Tại sao không chọn B (Processing steps): o ProcessingStep trong SageMaker Pipelines dùng để chạy code (Python/bash) bên trong các container do SageMaker quản lý (Processing Job). Nó không có chức năng nhận đầu vào là ARN của một AWS Glue Job để kích hoạt job đó từ xa. o Để dùng cách này, bạn phải migrate (di chuyển) code từ Glue sang SageMaker Processing, điều này tốn rất nhiều công sức và bỏ phí tài nguyên Glue đã thiết lập.

Tính năng này cho phép bạn định nghĩa các chính sách bảo mật (masking policies) để ẩn hoặc thay đổi định dạng dữ liệu nhạy cảm (như số thẻ tín dụng, SSN) ngay tại thời điểm truy vấn (query time) dựa trên vai trò của người dùng (Data Scientist). o Least Implementation Effort: Bạn chỉ cần áp dụng policy lên cột dữ liệu và gắn nó với role của Data Scientist. Không cần tạo bảng mới, view mới hay job ETL phức tạp. Tại sao không chọn B (Materialized view with masking logic): o Vi phạm yêu cầu về lưu trữ: Materialized View về bản chất là một bảng vật lý lưu trữ kết quả của câu query. Điều này vi phạm yêu cầu \"without storing anonymized data in the database\" của đề bài. o Materialized View cũng tiêu tốn tài nguyên lưu trữ và cần cơ chế refresh để đồng bộ dữ liệu, gây thêm gánh nặng quản trị (overhead) so với DDM. Tại sao không chọn C (Unload to S3 + Athena): o Implementation Effort cao: Bạn phải thực hiện nhiều bước: Unload dữ liệu ra S3 $\\rightarrow$ Crawler/Define Schema trong Glue/Athena $\\rightarrow$ Viết View trong Athena. Quá trình này phức tạp hơn nhiều so với việc cấu hình policy trực tiếp trên Redshift. o Việc di chuyển dữ liệu ra khỏi Redshift cũng làm tăng rủi ro bảo mật và độ trễ khi truy cập. Tại sao không chọn D (Unload to S3 + Glue Job): o Vi phạm yêu cầu: Đề bài cấm \"storing anonymized data\". Glue job sẽ xử lý và sinh ra một dataset mới đã ẩn danh và lưu nó xuống S3 (hoặc load lại DB), tức là tạo ra bản sao dữ liệu. o Đây là giải pháp tốn kém nhất về công sức triển khai (viết code ETL) và chi phí vận hành (trả tiền cho Glue DPU)."

Khi dữ liệu time-series được tổ chức thành các partition theo cấu trúc thư mục (ví dụ: s3://bucket/data/year=2024/month=01/day=11/), Athena có thể sử dụng kỹ thuật Partition Pruning. o Khi Engineer truy vấn dữ liệu \"3 ngày qua\", Athena chỉ quét đúng 3 thư mục tương ứng và bỏ qua toàn bộ dữ liệu của 27 ngày còn lại. Điều này giúp giảm đáng kể I/O, làm cho truy vấn nhanh hơn rất nhiều so với việc quét toàn bộ (Full scan). o Tự động hóa lưu trữ: S3 Lifecycle Policies hoạt động hiệu quả trên các prefix (thư mục), cho phép tự động chuyển data cũ (>30 ngày) sang Glacier để tiết kiệm chi phí mà không cần can thiệp thủ công. Tại sao không chọn A (No partitioning): o Nếu không phân vùng (partition), Athena buộc phải thực hiện Full Table Scan (quét toàn bộ file trong bucket) cho bất kỳ câu lệnh truy vấn nào, dù chỉ cần data của 1 ngày. Điều này khiến tốc độ truy vấn cực chậm khi dữ liệu lớn dần và chi phí tăng vọt. o Việc di chuyển dữ liệu thủ công (Manually move) là gánh nặng vận hành không cần thiết. Tại sao không chọn B (Lambda to separate buckets): o Việc sao chép dữ liệu (copy) tạo ra sự dư thừa lưu trữ (duplication) và tốn chi phí không đáng có. o Phân tán dữ liệu ra nhiều bucket làm phức tạp hóa việc định nghĩa bảng trong Athena (Athena table thường trỏ về một location gốc duy nhất). Việc join dữ liệu từ nhiều bucket khác nhau sẽ làm giảm hiệu năng truy vấn. Tại sao không chọn D (One bucket per day): o Đây là một thiết kế \"anti-pattern\" trong Data Lake.

Tại sao không chọn B (Batch Transform): o Batch Transform dùng để xử lý dữ liệu hàng loạt (offline processing) cho lượng lớn dữ liệu được lưu sẵn trong S3, không phải cho ứng dụng tương tác thời gian thực. Độ trễ của nó là phút hoặc giờ, tệ hơn cả Asynchronous Inference. Tại sao không chọn C (Serverless Inference + Inference Recommender): o Serverless Inference: Mặc dù tiện lợi, nhưng Serverless Inference có thể gặp vấn đề \"Cold Start\" (khởi động nguội) gây độ trễ ngẫu nhiên, không ổn định bằng Real-time Inference (Provisioned instances) cho các ứng dụng ngân hàng quan trọng. o Sai công cụ: SageMaker Inference Recommender là công cụ dùng để load test và gợi ý chọn loại instance/cấu hình tối ưu trước khi triển khai, chứ không phải là công cụ giám sát chất lượng model (quality deviation) liên tục trong khi vận hành (runtime). Tại sao không chọn D (Keep Asynchronous Inference): o Như đã giải thích ở mục A, bản chất của Asynchronous Inference là nguyên nhân gây ra độ trễ. Giữ nguyên kiến trúc này sẽ không giải quyết được vấn đề cốt lõi của người dùng (\"consumers are reporting delays\")."

    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn D (SageMaker Endpoint Auto Scaling): o Khả năng mở rộng (Scalable): Amazon SageMaker Endpoints hỗ trợ tính năng Application Auto Scaling tích hợp sẵn. Bạn có thể định nghĩa chính sách (scaling policy) dựa trên các chỉ số CloudWatch (như InvocationsPerInstance hoặc CPUUtilization). o Tối ưu chi phí & Hiệu năng: Hệ thống sẽ tự động thêm instance (Scale Out) khi traffic tăng để đảm bảo năng lực xử lý giờ cao điểm, và quan trọng hơn là tự động tắt bớt instance (Scale In) khi traffic giảm hoặc không có người dùng, giúp giảm thiểu chi phí đúng theo yêu cầu đề bài. Tại sao không chọn A (Lambda with fixed concurrency): o Mâu thuẫn kỹ thuật: Việc thiết lập \"fixed concurrency\" (đồng thời cố định) đồng nghĩa với việc bạn giới hạn khả năng mở rộng của Lambda, đi ngược lại với yêu cầu \"configure... to automatically scale\". o Ngoài ra, Lambda có giới hạn về thời gian chạy (timeout) và dung lượng bộ nhớ, thường không phải là lựa chọn tối ưu cho các model ML phức tạp cần stateful hosting. Tại sao không chọn B (ECS Fargate with static tasks): o Lãng phí chi phí: \"Static number of tasks\" (Số lượng tác vụ tĩnh) có nghĩa là bạn phải luôn duy trì số lượng container đủ để chịu tải cho lúc cao điểm nhất (peak usage). Khi traffic thấp, các resource này vẫn chạy và tính tiền, vi phạm yêu cầu \"minimizes costs when the model is not in use\". Tại sao không chọn C (SageMaker Endpoint + Manual ALB): o Sai kiến trúc: SageMaker Endpoint bản thân nó đã bao gồm một lớp Load Balancer nội bộ để phân phối traffic tới các instance phía sau. Bạn không cần (và không thể) tạo thủ công một Application Load Balancer (ALB) để điều hướng traffic giữa các model copy bên trong một endpoint. o Thiếu cơ chế Auto Scaling để tối ưu chi phí."

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn B (SageMaker User Profile Tags + AWS Budgets): o Resource Tagging: Trong Amazon SageMaker Studio, để theo dõi chi phí theo từng người dùng hoặc nhóm, bạn cần gắn thẻ (tag) vào SageMaker User Profile. Các thẻ này sẽ tự động được lan truyền (propagate) xuống các tài nguyên tính toán (như Apps, Notebooks, Training Jobs) mà user đó tạo ra. Điều này cho phép phân bổ chi phí (Cost Allocation) chính xác trong hóa đơn. o Alerting: AWS Budgets là dịch vụ chuyên dụng để thiết lập ngân sách và gửi thông báo cảnh báo (email/SNS) khi chi phí thực tế hoặc dự báo vượt quá ngưỡng (threshold) bạn đặt ra. Đây là giải pháp tiêu chuẩn cho yêu cầu \"automated alert when costs reach a specific threshold\". Tại sao không chọn A (AWS Cost Explorer): o Sai chức năng: AWS Cost Explorer chủ yếu là công cụ để phân tích và báo cáo lịch sử chi phí hoặc dự báo. Mặc dù nó có tính năng Cost Anomaly Detection, nhưng để thiết lập một cảnh báo ngưỡng cố định đơn giản (ví dụ: \"Báo cho tôi khi tiêu hết $100\"), AWS Budgets là công cụ trực tiếp và phù hợp hơn. Tại sao không chọn C và D (Tagging IAM Profile): o Cơ chế không hiệu quả: Việc gắn tag vào IAM User hoặc IAM Role không tự động gán tag đó cho các tài nguyên (như EC2 instances, SageMaker Jobs) mà IAM identity đó tạo ra. Do đó, trong bảng phân tích chi phí (Cost Allocation Report), các tài nguyên SageMaker sẽ không mang tag của IAM user, khiến việc theo dõi chi phí theo user trở nên bất khả thi theo cách này. o Riêng C còn sai vì dùng Cost Explorer để alert như lý do ở mục A."

    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn D (SageMaker Data Wrangler): o Least Effort (Nỗ lực ít nhất): SageMaker Data Wrangler là công cụ Low- code/No-code (Giao diện người dùng đồ họa) được tích hợp sẵn trong SageMaker Studio. Nó cho phép bạn import dữ liệu từ S3, xem trước (visualize), và thực hiện các thao tác xử lý dữ liệu như Drop Column chỉ bằng các cú click chuột mà không cần viết một dòng code nào. o Đối với file kích thước nhỏ (50 MB) và yêu cầu đơn giản (bỏ cột), việc sử dụng công cụ UI kéo-thả là nhanh chóng và tiện lợi nhất so với việc phải viết code và setup môi trường. Tại sao không chọn A (Download to local workstation): o Bad Practice: Việc download dữ liệu ra khỏi môi trường Cloud (AWS) về máy local thường bị hạn chế vì lý do bảo mật và quản trị dữ liệu (Data Governance). o Manual process: Đây là quy trình thủ công, khó tự động hóa và không thể scale nếu sau này file lớn hơn hoặc cần xử lý định kỳ. Tại sao không chọn B (Amazon EMR Spark job): o Overkill (Dùng dao mổ trâu giết gà): Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce) là dịch vụ dành cho Big Data xử lý hàng TB/PB dữ liệu. Việc khởi tạo và cấu hình cả một cluster EMR chỉ để xử lý một file 50 MB là cực kỳ lãng phí tài nguyên, tiền bạc và công sức quản trị. Tại sao không chọn C (SageMaker Processing Job): o High Effort: Để chạy Processing Job, bạn phải viết script Python, chuẩn bị Docker container, và cấu hình SDK để submit job. Mặc dù đây là cách chuẩn cho quy trình tự động hóa (MLOps), nhưng so với việc click chuột trong Data Wrangler cho một tác vụ ad-hoc đơn giản, thì Processing Job tốn nhiều công sức triển khai hơn (coding overhead)."

Đây là giải pháp \"Hard block\" (chặn cứng) đảm bảo tuân thủ yêu cầu đề bài một cách chính xác nhất. Tại sao không chọn B (Retriever exclusion): o Việc cấu hình Retriever để loại bỏ tên đối thủ thường tác động vào việc tìm kiếm tài liệu (filtering documents). Nếu một tài liệu sản phẩm hợp lệ của công ty có chứa tên đối thủ (ví dụ: trong bảng so sánh), tài liệu đó có thể bị loại bỏ hoàn toàn, dẫn đến mất thông tin ngữ cảnh cần thiết.

Bạn chỉ cần chọn model từ JumpStart, cung cấp dataset, và Autopilot sẽ tự động chạy experiment để fine-tune mà không cần viết code training phức tạp. o Deployment: Sau khi fine-tune xong, model có thể được deploy dễ dàng thông qua cơ chế \"One-click deployment\" của JumpStart (hoặc tạo Endpoint từ Model Package của Autopilot), đảm bảo tính chất Low-code từ đầu đến cuối. Tại sao không chọn A (SageMaker Studio + EC2): o Việc tự fine-tune trên Studio và quản lý triển khai thủ công lên EC2 instances là phương pháp High-code (nhiều code), đòi hỏi kiến thức sâu về quản trị hạ tầng và scripting, vi phạm yêu cầu LCNC. Tại sao không chọn B (Custom API endpoint): o \"Custom API endpoint\" ám chỉ việc bạn phải tự xây dựng lớp API (ví dụ dùng Flask/FastAPI, Dockerize, setup Server), đây là công việc nặng về kỹ thuật (Engineering heavy), không phải Low-code.

    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn D (Serverless inference endpoint): o Tối ưu chi phí cho traffic ngắt quãng: Mô hình chỉ chạy \"một lần mỗi đêm\" (intermittent traffic). SageMaker Serverless Inference có khả năng tự động Scale to 0 khi không có request, nghĩa là bạn không tốn bất kỳ chi phí nào cho thời gian chờ (idle time). Bạn chỉ trả tiền cho đúng khoảng thời gian tính toán (< 1 phút) mà mô hình chạy. o Phù hợp với workload: Serverless Inference hỗ trợ payload lên tới 4MB (đề bài 3MB) và thời gian xử lý tối đa 3 phút (đề bài < 1 phút), hoàn toàn phù hợp với yêu cầu kỹ thuật này. o MaxConcurrency = 1: Vì chỉ chạy 1 lần/đêm, không cần xử lý song song, đặt concurrency = 1 để giới hạn tài nguyên là hợp lý. Tại sao không chọn A (Multi-model serverless): o Dư thừa: Multi-model Endpoint (MME) được thiết kế để host hàng trăm/hàng ngàn model khác nhau trên cùng một container chung để tiết kiệm chi phí. Ở đây chỉ có một model duy nhất, nên việc dùng MME là không cần thiết và làm phức tạp cấu hình. Tại sao không chọn B (Asynchronous inference endpoint): o Sai mục đích: Asynchronous Inference thường dùng cho các payload rất lớn (lên tới 1GB) hoặc thời gian xử lý rất dài (lên tới 1 giờ). Với input nhỏ (3 MB) và xử lý nhanh (< 1 phút), Serverless Inference nhanh gọn và đơn giản hơn nhiều so với việc quản lý hàng đợi (queue) của Async. Tại sao không chọn C (Real-time endpoint scale to 0): o Lỗi kỹ thuật: Standard Real-time Endpoint (Provisioned Instances) không thể scale về 0. Số lượng instance tối thiểu luôn là 1.

Bằng cách chủ động thêm nhiễu vào dữ liệu huấn luyện, bạn ép mô hình học các đặc trưng quan trọng (như hình dáng xe, va chạm) thay vì phụ thuộc vào độ sắc nét hay chất lượng điểm ảnh. o Kỹ thuật này giúp mô hình \"miễn nhiễm\" tốt hơn với các biến thể chất lượng thấp từ camera thực tế mà không cần thu thập thêm dữ liệu mới. Tại sao không chọn A (Collect more images): o Vi phạm ràng buộc thời gian: Đề bài yêu cầu giải pháp tốn \"LEAST amount of time\". Việc thu thập thêm hình ảnh từ camera, gán nhãn lại (labeling), và chuẩn bị dữ liệu mới là một quy trình cực kỳ tốn thời gian và công sức so với việc chỉ click chọn biến đổi (transform) trên dữ liệu có sẵn. Tại sao không chọn C (Enhance image contrast): o Sai mục tiêu: \"Enhance image contrast\" (Tăng độ tương phản) thường dùng để xử lý vấn đề về ánh sáng (quá tối/quá sáng). Tuy nhiên, \"variations in quality\" từ CCTV thường ám chỉ nhiễu hạt (grain), mờ (blur) hoặc nén ảnh (compression artifacts). o Việc tăng tương phản cho ảnh nhiễu đôi khi còn làm tệ hơn (khuếch đại nhiễu). Quan trọng hơn, để mô hình chịu được ảnh xấu, ta cần train nó trên ảnh xấu (Option B), chứ không phải train trên ảnh đã được làm đẹp (Option C) trừ khi ta cũng áp dụng bước làm đẹp đó cho production pipeline (điều này làm tăng độ trễ). Tại sao không chọn D (Resize/Crop): o Không liên quan: Resize và Crop chỉ giải quyết vấn đề về kích thước hoặc tỷ lệ khung hình (dimension/aspect ratio), hoàn toàn không giúp cải thiện khả năng nhận diện của mô hình đối với các vấn đề về chất lượng hình ảnh (nhiễu/mờ)."

Đây là bài toán Phân loại nhị phân (Binary Classification) với đầu ra là 0 (Không) hoặc 1 (Có). o Cơ chế kỹ thuật: Logistic Regression là thuật toán cơ bản và hiệu quả nhất cho bài toán phân loại nhị phân. Nó sử dụng hàm Sigmoid để chuyển đổi đầu ra thành xác suất (từ 0 đến 1) cho việc ra quyết định Yes/No. Tại sao không chọn A (Anomaly detection): o Anomaly detection (Phát hiện bất thường) được dùng để tìm ra các điểm dữ liệu hiếm gặp hoặc khác biệt so với phần còn lại (ví dụ: phát hiện gian lận thẻ tín dụng). Nó không dùng để phân loại hai nhóm khách hàng có tính chất rõ ràng như nhau. Tại sao không chọn B (Linear regression): o Linear Regression (Hồi quy tuyến tính) dùng để dự đoán giá trị liên tục (Continuous values) như giá nhà, nhiệt độ, doanh thu.

    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn B (S3 Permissions): o Quyền truy cập vật lý: Model artifacts (file model.tar.gz, weights, code) đang nằm trong Amazon S3. Để SageMaker Canvas (và người dùng Canvas) có thể load được model này lên để tiếp tục fine-tune, role IAM của người dùng Canvas bắt buộc phải có quyền s3:GetObject đối với bucket chứa artifacts. Nếu không có quyền này, quá trình import sẽ thất bại ngay lập tức do \"Access Denied\". Tại sao chọn C (SageMaker Model Registry): o Cơ chế tích hợp (The Bridge): SageMaker Canvas được thiết kế để tích hợp chặt chẽ với SageMaker Model Registry. Để mang một model được train bên ngoài (outside SageMaker) vào trong Canvas, quy trình chuẩn là bạn phải đóng gói và đăng ký model đó vào Model Registry (tạo Model Package Group). o Sau khi đăng ký, người dùng Canvas có thể dễ dàng nhìn thấy model trong giao diện Canvas và chọn \"Import\" để tinh chỉnh tiếp. Đây là cầu nối quản lý phiên bản và metadata cần thiết. Tại sao không chọn A (Separate SageMaker domains): o Đây không phải là yêu cầu kỹ thuật. Thực tế, việc hai người dùng nằm trong cùng một Domain (như đề bài đã nêu) càng thuận lợi cho việc chia sẻ tài nguyên và profile. Việc tách ra separate domains sẽ làm phức tạp hóa vấn đề permission (cross-account/cross-domain access) chứ không giúp ích gì cho việc share model. Tại sao không chọn D (AWS Marketplace): o AWS Marketplace dùng để bán hoặc chia sẻ model công khai cho cộng đồng/khách hàng bên ngoài. Việc chia sẻ nội bộ giữa Engineer và Canvas user trong cùng công ty không cần thông qua Marketplace. Tại sao không chọn E (Deploy to endpoint): o Sai mục đích: Endpoint dùng để phục vụ suy luận (Inference/Prediction). Người dùng Canvas cần thực hiện \"additional tuning\" (tức là huấn luyện lại/fine-tuning). Để tune model, Canvas cần truy cập vào model artifacts (file gốc) chứ không phải gọi API vào một endpoint đang chạy."

Sau đó, nó đánh giá hiệu năng, loại bỏ ngay lập tức một nửa số model kém hiệu quả (pruning) và chỉ cấp thêm tài nguyên (epochs) cho các model tốt nhất để chạy tiếp. o Kết quả: Nhờ việc không lãng phí tài nguyên tính toán vào các model \"vô vọng\", Hyperband có thể tìm ra model tối ưu nhanh hơn gấp nhiều lần (trên AWS SageMaker nhanh hơn tới 3 lần) so với Bayesian Optimization trên các tập dữ liệu lớn. Tại sao không chọn B (Grid search): o Duyệt toàn bộ (Exhaustive): Grid search thử nghiệm tất cả các tổ hợp có thể. Với Deep Learning, không gian tham số rất lớn, Grid Search sẽ gây ra bùng nổ tổ hợp (combinatorial explosion), dẫn đến thời gian tính toán cực kỳ lớn, không thể chấp nhận được. Tại sao không chọn C (Bayesian optimization): o Chạy tuần tự: Mặc dù Bayesian Optimization \"thông minh\" hơn Random Search vì nó học từ các kết quả trước đó để đoán tham số tiếp theo, nhưng theo mặc định, nó thường chạy các training job đến khi hoàn thành (to completion) để lấy kết quả chính xác. Điều này khiến nó chậm hơn Hyperband trong bối cảnh Deep Learning tốn kém, nơi việc phát hiện sớm và loại bỏ model xấu quan trọng hơn là train kỹ từng model. Tại sao không chọn D (Random search): o May rủi: Random search chọn ngẫu nhiên và cũng thường chạy hết thời gian training cho mỗi job.

    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn D (S3 Gateway Endpoint + Cross-account Policy): o Kết nối riêng tư tới S3 (Private Connectivity): Để truy cập Amazon S3 từ một VPC mà không đi qua Internet công cộng (Public IPv4), giải pháp chuẩn là sử dụng VPC Gateway Endpoint cho S3. Gateway Endpoint sẽ thêm một route vào bảng định tuyến (Route Table) của VPC, hướng toàn bộ lưu lượng S3 đi qua mạng nội bộ của AWS. o Truy cập chéo tài khoản (Cross-account Access): Vì dữ liệu nằm ở tài khoản phụ (Secondary account), bạn cần cập nhật S3 Bucket Policy ở tài khoản phụ để cấp quyền (Allow) cho IAM Principal (Role mà Redshift/SageMaker sử dụng) ở tài khoản chính (Primary account). o Interface Endpoints: Cần thiết lập Interface VPC Endpoints cho SageMaker API và Redshift API để các dịch vụ này có thể giao tiếp với Control Plane của AWS một cách riêng tư mà không cần NAT Gateway hay Internet Gateway. Tại sao không chọn A (VPC Peering): o VPC Peering dùng để kết nối 2 VPC với nhau. Tuy nhiên, S3 là dịch vụ nằm ngoài VPC (Regional Service). Việc peering 2 VPC không giải quyết trực tiếp vấn đề truy cập S3 một cách hiệu quả. S3 Gateway Endpoint tại VPC nguồn là cách trực tiếp nhất. Ngoài ra, VPC Peering không thay thế được nhu cầu về S3 Bucket Policy để cấp quyền truy cập dữ liệu. Tại sao không chọn B (Direct Connect + Transit Gateway): o Overkill và sai mục đích: AWS Direct Connect dùng để kết nối trung tâm dữ liệu on-premise với AWS. Transit Gateway dùng để kết nối nhiều VPC. Cả hai đều là giải pháp hạ tầng mạng phức tạp và tốn kém, không cần thiết cho việc truy cập S3 (vốn chỉ cần Gateway Endpoint). Tại sao không chọn C (Site-to-Site VPN): o Site-to-Site VPN dùng để tạo kết nối bảo mật giữa mạng on-premise và AWS VPC qua internet. Nó không dùng để kết nối hai tài khoản AWS với nhau để truy cập S3. Việc định tuyến traffic S3 qua VPN tunnel là không khả thi và hiệu năng rất thấp so với Gateway Endpoint."

    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn C (Create a new baseline): Trong Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor, chức năng Data Quality Monitor hoạt động bằng cách so sánh dữ liệu thực tế (live inference data) với một tập dữ liệu tham chiếu, được gọi là Baseline (thường được tạo ra từ tập dữ liệu huấn luyện - training dataset). Đề bài nêu rõ vấn đề xuất hiện \"After a model update\" (Sau khi cập nhật model). Khi một model mới được deploy, nó thường được huấn luyện trên dữ liệu mới hoặc có sự thay đổi về phân phối dữ liệu (data distribution). Nếu bạn không cập nhật Baseline, Model Monitor sẽ tiếp tục so sánh dữ liệu mới với Baseline cũ (của phiên bản model trước đó). Sự sai lệch này sẽ dẫn đến việc Model Monitor báo cáo sai các vấn đề về chất lượng dữ liệu (False Positives). Do đó, hành động chính xác là phải tạo một baseline mới từ tập dữ liệu mới nhất (được dùng để train model hiện tại) và cập nhật cấu hình Model Monitor để phản ánh đúng thực tế \"bình thường mới\". Tại sao không chọn A (Adjust parameters/hyperparameters): Việc điều chỉnh tham số (parameters) hoặc siêu tham số (hyperparameters) chỉ ảnh hưởng đến hiệu suất và hành vi dự đoán của model (model performance). Nó không thay đổi các quy tắc (rules) hoặc ngưỡng thống kê (statistics) mà Model Monitor sử dụng để xác định \"chất lượng dữ liệu\". Nếu Baseline không đổi, lỗi vẫn sẽ được báo cáo bất kể model hoạt động thế nào. Tại sao không chọn B (Initiate a manual job): Chạy lại job kiểm tra (Model Monitor job) một cách thủ công mà không thay đổi cấu hình cơ bản (Baseline) sẽ chỉ cho ra kết quả y hệt như cũ. Công cụ vẫn sẽ dùng bộ quy tắc cũ để so sánh với dữ liệu mới và lại tiếp tục báo lỗi. Đây là hành động lãng phí tài nguyên tính toán mà không giải quyết được nguyên nhân gốc rễ. Tại sao không chọn D (Include additional data ... Retrain): Đề bài cho biết model vừa mới được cập nhật (\"After a model update\").

SageMaker Asynchronous Inference là dịch vụ hoàn hảo cho trường hợp này vì: . Hỗ trợ Large Payload: Không giống như Real-time Inference (giới hạn payload nhỏ, thường < 6MB), Asynchronous Inference cho phép xử lý payload lên tới 1 GB bằng cách lưu trữ input/output trên Amazon S3, giải quyết trực tiếp vấn đề ảnh 50 MB. . Managed Auto-scaling (Scale to Zero): Dịch vụ này có hàng đợi (queue) tích hợp sẵn và khả năng tự động scale số lượng instance dựa trên lượng request trong hàng đợi, thậm chí scale xuống 0 khi không có request để tiết kiệm chi phí. Điều này giúp loại bỏ gánh nặng quản lý hạ tầng thủ công. Tại sao không chọn A (SageMaker Batch Transform): Batch Transform phù hợp cho việc xử lý offline hàng loạt dữ liệu lớn đã có sẵn (ví dụ: chạy job mỗi đêm), không phù hợp cho mô hình tương tác trên website nơi khách hàng upload và cần kết quả trong thời gian hợp lý (near real-time). Batch Transform không phải là một endpoint luôn sẵn sàng phục vụ request đơn lẻ ngay lập tức. Tại sao không chọn C (Amazon EKS + Karpenter): Phương án này vi phạm nghiêm trọng tiêu chí \"Least operational overhead\". Việc dựng và quản lý một cụm Kubernetes (EKS), cài đặt và cấu hình Karpenter để autoscaling, cũng như quản lý container pods đòi hỏi nỗ lực kỹ thuật và bảo trì cực lớn so với việc sử dụng dịch vụ managed có sẵn như SageMaker. Tại sao không chọn D (AWS Batch on ECS): Tương tự như phương án A, AWS Batch được thiết kế cho các tác vụ tính toán hàng loạt (batch computing) thay vì phục vụ suy luận mô hình theo hướng sự kiện (event-driven inference). Việc cấu hình Job Queues, Compute Environments và Job Definitions trên ECS phức tạp hơn nhiều so với việc chỉ cần deploy một endpoint Asynchronous trên SageMaker."

SageMaker Serverless Inference là giải pháp tối ưu nhất vì nó có khả năng Scale to Zero (tự động tắt hoàn toàn khi không có request), giúp tiết kiệm chi phí tuyệt đối trong thời gian nhàn rỗi mà không cần quản lý hạ tầng thủ công. . Handling Load: Với yêu cầu \"quick responses\" (phản hồi nhanh) cho \"multiple invocations\" (nhiều lượt gọi), đây là đặc điểm của mô hình API Endpoint chứ không phải xử lý Batch. Mặc dù thuật ngữ \"Provisioned Concurrency\" thường gắn liền với Lambda hoặc SageMaker Real-time, trong ngữ cảnh câu hỏi này, nó ám chỉ việc cấu hình khả năng xử lý đồng thời (concurrency) để đảm bảo endpoint chịu được tải \"sustained\" (liên tục) trong 2 giờ cao điểm mà không bị nghẽn. Tại sao không chọn A (SageMaker batch transform): Batch Transform được thiết kế để xử lý offline các tập dữ liệu lớn (bulk processing). Người dùng upload file dữ liệu lên S3, chờ xử lý xong và nhận kết quả trả về S3. Nó hoạt động theo cơ chế bất đồng bộ (asynchronous) và không cung cấp \"quick responses\" (phản hồi tức thì) cho từng invocation riêng lẻ theo thời gian thực như yêu cầu đề bài. Tại sao không chọn B (EC2 Auto Scaling): Sử dụng EC2 yêu cầu bạn phải tự quản lý hệ điều hành (OS), cài đặt môi trường (Docker/Python), cấu hình Load Balancer và Auto Scaling Group. Điều này vi phạm yêu cầu quan trọng của đề bài là \"AWS to manage the underlying infrastructure\" (AWS quản lý hạ tầng cơ sở). Đây là giải pháp có chi phí vận hành (Operational Overhead) cao nhất. Tại sao không chọn D (EKS Cluster): Tương tự như EC2, việc vận hành một cụm Kubernetes (EKS) đòi hỏi kiến thức chuyên sâu về container orchestration và nỗ lực quản trị rất lớn (quản..."

    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn B (SageMaker Clarify): Amazon SageMaker Clarify là dịch vụ chuyên biệt được thiết kế để cung cấp khả năng giải thích mô hình (Model Explainability) và phát hiện thiên kiến (Bias Detection). Nó sử dụng phương pháp SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) để phân tích và định lượng mức độ đóng góp của từng đặc trưng (feature) vào kết quả dự đoán cuối cùng. Đối với bài toán phân tích cảm xúc (Sentiment Analysis), Clarify sẽ chỉ ra những từ ngữ hoặc cụm từ nào (feature importance) đã khiến model đưa ra kết quả là \"Tích cực\" hay \"Tiêu cực\", giúp các bên liên quan (stakeholders) hiểu rõ cơ chế ra quyết định của model. Tại sao không chọn A (SageMaker Model Monitor): SageMaker Model Monitor có nhiệm vụ chính là giám sát liên tục chất lượng của model và dữ liệu theo thời gian thực (ví dụ: phát hiện Data Drift, Model Quality Drift). Mặc dù nó có thể theo dõi sự thay đổi về Feature Attribution (sử dụng công nghệ của Clarify bên dưới), nhưng khi nhắc đến nhu cầu cốt lõi là \"giải thích model hoạt động thế nào\" cho con người hiểu, SageMaker Clarify là công cụ trực tiếp và chính xác nhất. Tại sao không chọn C (A/B testing in CloudWatch): A/B Testing được sử dụng để so sánh hiệu năng (performance) giữa hai phiên bản model khác nhau (ví dụ: Model A chính xác hơn Model B bao nhiêu %). Nó chỉ cho biết model nào tốt hơn, chứ không giải thích được tại sao model lại đưa ra một dự đoán cụ thể. Tại sao không chọn D (Shadow endpoint): Shadow testing (thử nghiệm bóng) là kỹ thuật triển khai model mới để nhận traffic thực tế nhưng không trả kết quả cho người dùng (chỉ để log lại và so sánh). Mục đích của nó là kiểm tra độ ổn định và lỗi của model mới trước khi promote lên production, không liên quan đến việc giải thích logic bên trong model."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn C (Same Region & Availability Zone): Trong huấn luyện phân tán (Distributed Training), các instance (nút tính toán) phải thường xuyên trao đổi thông tin (như gradients trong Data Parallelism) với nhau. \"Communication overhead\" (độ trễ mạng) là kẻ thù lớn nhất làm chậm quá trình này. Để giảm thiểu độ trễ xuống mức thấp nhất, giải pháp tối ưu là đặt tất cả tài nguyên (Compute Instances và Data Storage) gần nhau nhất có thể về mặt vật lý. . Network Latency: Một Subnet trong AWS luôn nằm trọn trong một Availability Zone (AZ). Việc đặt các instance trong cùng một subnet đảm bảo chúng nằm trong cùng một AZ (thậm chí cùng data center), giúp lưu lượng mạng đi qua đường truyền tốc độ cao nội bộ (intra-AZ), thay vì phải đi vòng qua các đường truyền liên kết giữa các AZ (inter-AZ) hoặc giữa các Region. . Data Proximity: Đặt dữ liệu (S3/EFS/FSx) cùng Region và AZ với instance giúp giảm thời gian tải dữ liệu (I/O latency), tránh nghẽn cổ chai khi model đọc dữ liệu huấn luyện. Tại sao không chọn A (Data in different AWS Region): Việc lưu trữ dữ liệu ở một Region khác với nơi đặt instance sẽ tạo ra độ trễ mạng cực lớn (hàng chục đến hàng trăm ms) khi tải dữ liệu. Điều này sẽ khiến GPU/CPU phải chờ đợi (idle) trong khi dữ liệu được truyền qua internet, làm giảm hiệu suất nghiêm trọng. Tại sao không chọn B (Different Availability Zones): Về mặt kỹ thuật AWS, một Subnet không thể kéo dài qua nhiều AZ (1 Subnet = 1 AZ). Do đó, mệnh đề \"same VPC subnet but in different Availability Zones\" là không khả thi. Hơn nữa, giao tiếp giữa các AZ (Cross-AZ traffic) luôn có độ trễ cao hơn so với giao tiếp trong cùng một AZ. Tại sao không chọn D (Data in different Availability Zone): Mặc dù tốt hơn việc khác Region, nhưng việc truy cập dữ liệu từ một AZ khác vẫn phải chịu phí truyền tải dữ liệu (Cross-AZ data transfer cost) và độ trễ cao hơn so với việc dữ liệu nằm ngay tại local AZ."

SageMaker Script Mode cho phép bạn tái sử dụng trực tiếp các file train.py (custom Python scripts) hiện có. Bạn không cần phải đóng gói Docker container từ đầu. Thay vào đó, bạn chỉ cần chỉ định framework (ở đây là PyTorch) và AWS sẽ tự động cung cấp một Premade Image (Container đã cài sẵn PyTorch và các thư viện cần thiết). Bạn chỉ việc \"mang code đến\" và chạy, giúp giảm thiểu tối đa việc thay đổi mã nguồn hay cấu hình hạ tầng. Tại sao không chọn A (SageMaker built-in algorithms): Các thuật toán tích hợp sẵn (Built-in algorithms) của SageMaker (như XGBoost, Image Classification...) là các hộp đen (black-box) được tối ưu hóa cho các tác vụ cụ thể. Vì đề bài nói mô hình yêu cầu \"unique domain knowledge\" và được viết bằng custom scripts, việc ép logic phức tạp này vào các thuật toán có sẵn thường không khả thi hoặc đòi hỏi phải viết lại toàn bộ logic xử lý dữ liệu và huấn luyện, tốn rất nhiều công sức. Tại sao không chọn C (Build a container - BYOC): Phương pháp \"Bring Your Own Container\" (BYOC) yêu cầu bạn phải tự viết Dockerfile, cài đặt môi trường, tuân thủ cấu trúc thư mục của SageMaker (/opt/ml/...), build image và push lên Amazon ECR. Đây là quy trình phức tạp và tốn công sức vận hành hơn rất nhiều so với việc sử dụng Script Mode (nơi AWS đã lo phần Container cho bạn). Tại sao không chọn D (AWS Marketplace): Mô hình của công ty chứa \"unique domain knowledge\" (kiến thức nghiệp vụ độc quyền/đặc thù). Các mô hình bán sẵn trên Marketplace là các giải pháp tổng quát, không thể chứa tri thức riêng biệt của công ty bạn được. Do đó, phương án này không đáp ứng được yêu cầu nghiệp vụ."

    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn B (FSx for Lustre): Bài toán yêu cầu cải thiện hiệu suất huấn luyện (improve training performance) cho hàng triệu file có kích thước vài MB (đây là workload yêu cầu thông lượng/throughput cực cao và độ trễ/latency thấp để nạp dữ liệu vào GPU/CPU). Amazon FSx for Lustre là hệ thống file hiệu năng cao được thiết kế đặc biệt cho các ứng dụng tính toán chuyên sâu (HPC) và Machine Learning. Tính năng \"Data Repository Association\" cho phép FSx for Lustre liên kết trực tiếp với S3 bucket hiện có. Khi training job chạy, dữ liệu sẽ được \"lazy load\" (tải khi cần) hoặc \"preload\" (tải trước) vào hệ thống file tốc độ cao này, giúp tăng tốc độ đọc dữ liệu lên gấp nhiều lần so với đọc trực tiếp từ S3 (đặc biệt là với File Mode). Đây là giải pháp chuẩn công nghiệp để tăng tốc training. Tại sao không chọn A (S3 Express One Zone): Mặc dù S3 Express One Zone có độ trễ thấp hơn S3 Standard, nhưng đối với các tác vụ ML training quy mô lớn cần throughput cực đại, FSx for Lustre vẫn vượt trội hơn nhờ khả năng caching và kiến trúc file system song song (parallel file system). Hơn nữa, việc copy toàn bộ dữ liệu sang bucket mới (vùng One Zone) sẽ tốn thời gian và công sức quản lý hơn so với việc chỉ cần \"link\" FSx vào bucket hiện tại. Tại sao không chọn C (Amazon EFS): Amazon EFS là hệ thống file dùng chung (General Purpose) cho Linux, phù hợp với các ứng dụng web hoặc chia sẻ dữ liệu thông thường. Mặc dù EFS có thể dùng cho SageMaker, nhưng throughput và IOPS của nó thấp hơn đáng kể so với FSx for Lustre trong các tác vụ huấn luyện Deep Learning yêu cầu băng thông dữ liệu lớn. Tại sao không chọn D (ElastiCache Redis): Redis là in-memory key-value store, không phải là File System. SageMaker Training Job thường mong đợi dữ liệu đầu vào dưới dạng File System (Local, EFS, FSx) hoặc S3 Object, chứ không hỗ trợ đọc trực tiếp stream dữ liệu từ Redis một cách tự nhiên (native integration) cho việc huấn luyện quy mô lớn.

AWS Glue DataBrew là công cụ chuẩn bị dữ liệu trực quan (visual data preparation tool) không cần viết code (no-code). Nó cung cấp sẵn các tính năng chuyển đổi (transformations) chuyên biệt để xử lý thông tin cá nhân (PII), bao gồm các kỹ thuật như Masking (che dấu), Hashing (băm), hoặc Shuffling (tráo đổi).

Tại sao không chọn A (AWS Glue + CloudWatch): Mặc dù AWS Glue có thể chạy code Python để thực hiện suy luận, nhưng nó là công cụ ETL (Trích xuất, Chuyển đổi, Tải), không được tối ưu hóa cho quản lý vòng đời ML (MLOps). Quan trọng hơn, CloudWatch là nơi nhận metrics chứ không phải công cụ phân tích dữ liệu để phát hiện lỗi chất lượng (như distribution drift).

    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn B (Keep training statistics): Đây là nguyên tắc bất di bất dịch trong Machine Learning: Dữ liệu Inference phải được xử lý giống hệt dữ liệu Training. Khi huấn luyện model, trọng số (weights) được điều chỉnh dựa trên phân phối và thang đo (scale) cụ thể của dữ liệu training (ví dụ: giá trị Min là 0, Max là 100). Khi đưa model ra thực tế (Inference), bạn phải áp dụng lại chính xác các tham số thống kê (Min, Max, Mean, Variance) đã tính được từ tập Training lên dữ liệu mới. Nếu bạn tính toán lại Min/Max dựa trên dữ liệu mới, bạn sẽ làm thay đổi thang đo, dẫn đến hiện tượng Training-Serving Skew (Lệch pha giữa huấn luyện và phục vụ), khiến model đưa ra dự đoán sai lệch hoàn toàn. Tại sao không chọn A (Well-known dataset): Thống kê từ một tập dữ liệu công khai (well-known dataset) không liên quan gì đến dữ liệu riêng của công ty bạn. Áp dụng thống kê ngoại lai này sẽ làm sai lệch bản chất của dữ liệu đầu vào. Tại sao không chọn C (New stats from batch): Nếu mỗi batch inference lại có một bộ Min/Max riêng, thì cùng một giá trị input (ví dụ: x = 50) sẽ bị biến đổi thành các giá trị khác nhau tùy thuộc vào việc nó nằm trong batch nào. Điều này làm mất tính nhất quán (inconsistency) và khiến model không thể dự đoán chính xác. Tại sao không chọn D (New stats from sample): Tính toán Min/Max trên một mẫu đơn lẻ (single sample) là vô nghĩa. Ví dụ: nếu mẫu chỉ có giá trị là 10, thì Min=10, Max=10. Khi áp dụng công thức (x - Min) / (Max - Min), bạn sẽ gặp lỗi chia cho 0 hoặc biến mọi giá trị thành 0. Nó triệt tiêu hoàn toàn thông tin của dữ liệu."

Tại sao không chọn A (S3 Lifecycle rule): S3 Lifecycle Rules chỉ dùng để quản lý vòng đời lưu trữ (ví dụ: chuyển dữ liệu sang lớp lưu trữ rẻ hơn như Glacier hoặc xóa tự động sau một thời gian). Nó không có chức năng kích hoạt các tác vụ tính toán hay khởi chạy quy trình ML bên ngoài. Tại sao không chọn B (Lambda polling/scanning): Phương án này yêu cầu bạn phải viết code cho hàm Lambda để quét S3 (polling) hoặc xử lý sự kiện, sau đó lại phải viết thêm logic để gọi API kích hoạt Pipeline. Việc viết, test và bảo trì code sẽ tốn công sức vận hành hơn nhiều so với giải pháp không cần code (no-code) của EventBridge. Tại sao không chọn D (Amazon MWAA): Amazon MWAA (Managed Airflow) là một dịch vụ điều phối workflow mạnh mẽ nhưng phức tạp và tốn kém (cần khởi tạo môi trường, quản lý DAGs). Sử dụng MWAA chỉ để bắt một sự kiện đơn giản như S3 upload là \"dùng dao mổ trâu để giết gà\" (over-engineering), không thỏa mãn tiêu chí \"Least operational effort\"."

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn D (Decrease max_depth): Hiện tượng mô hình hoạt động cực tốt trên tập dữ liệu huấn luyện (Training data) nhưng lại kém trên dữ liệu mới/chưa thấy (Unseen data) chính là định nghĩa kinh điển của Overfitting (Quá khớp). Điều này có nghĩa là mô hình quá phức tạp, nó đang \"học thuộc lòng\" các nhiễu (noise) của dữ liệu train thay vì học các quy luật tổng quát. Trong thuật toán XGBoost, siêu tham số max_depth kiểm soát độ sâu tối đa của cây quyết định. Cây càng sâu thì càng nắm bắt được nhiều chi tiết cụ thể của dữ liệu train (bao gồm cả nhiễu). Để khắc phục Overfitting, ta cần giảm độ phức tạp của mô hình bằng cách giảm max_depth. Cây nông hơn (shallower trees) sẽ buộc mô hình phải học các mẫu tổng quát hơn, từ đó cải thiện khả năng dự đoán trên dữ liệu mới. Tại sao không chọn A (Increase learning rate): Tăng tốc độ học (eta hoặc learning_rate) thường làm cho mô hình cập nhật trọng số nhanh hơn và mạnh hơn sau mỗi vòng lặp. Nếu không được kiểm soát kỹ, điều này thường dẫn đến việc mô hình hội tụ quá nhanh vào các điểm cực tiểu cục bộ hoặc làm tăng khả năng Overfitting, khiến tình trạng tồi tệ hơn. Tại sao không chọn B (Remove irrelevant features): Mặc dù loại bỏ các đặc trưng không liên quan (Feature Selection) là một phương pháp tốt để giảm nhiễu, nhưng trong bối cảnh tinh chỉnh siêu tham số (Hyperparameter Tuning) để xử lý Overfitting trực tiếp trên mô hình cây, việc điều chỉnh max_depth là biện pháp kỹ thuật trực diện và phổ biến nhất. Hơn nữa, đề bài không cung cấp thông tin khẳng định có \"irrelevant features\" hay không, trong khi triệu chứng Overfitting do model complexity là rất rõ ràng. Tại sao không chọn C (Increase max_depth): Tăng max_depth sẽ làm cho cây trở nên sâu hơn và phức tạp hơn. Điều này sẽ làm tăng khả năng \"học thuộc lòng\" dữ liệu train, khiến vấn đề Overfitting trở nên nghiêm trọng hơn thay vì giải quyết nó."

    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn C (SageMaker Pipelines + Lineage Tracking): Câu hỏi có hai nhóm yêu cầu chính: . Workflow Orchestration & Visualization: Cần kiểm soát chi tiết quy trình (fine-grained control) và trực quan hóa dưới dạng biểu đồ (DAG). SageMaker Pipelines là dịch vụ CI/CD chuyên dụng cho ML đầu tiên, cho phép định nghĩa quy trình bằng code (SDK) và tự động hiển thị biểu đồ trực quan (DAG Visualizer) ngay trong SageMaker Studio. . Audit & Compliance: Cần lưu lịch sử thí nghiệm và thiết lập quản trị (governance) cho mục đích kiểm toán. SageMaker ML Lineage Tracking là tính năng cốt lõi được thiết kế chính xác để truy vết nguồn gốc (lineage) của model (từ dữ liệu thô, code xử lý, đến artifact model cuối cùng). Nó lưu trữ siêu dữ liệu (metadata) của mọi bước, cho phép bạn trả lời câu hỏi \"Model này được tạo ra từ dữ liệu nào, bởi ai, và tham số gì?\" - đây chính là yêu cầu về auditing và compliance. Tại sao không chọn A & B (AWS CodePipeline): AWS CodePipeline là công cụ CI/CD đa năng cho DevOps (phát triển phần mềm), không được thiết kế chuyên biệt cho các đặc thù của ML (như visualize DAG của các bước training/processing step, caching các bước ML). Mặc dù có thể dùng, nhưng nó thiếu tính năng \"fine-grained control\" và tích hợp sâu (native integration) với hệ sinh thái SageMaker Studio để visualize DAG cho Data Scientist như SageMaker Pipelines. Tại sao không chọn D (SageMaker Experiments cho governance): Mặc dù SageMaker Experiments giúp tổ chức và theo dõi các lần chạy huấn luyện (runs/trials), nhưng mục đích chính của nó là so sánh hiệu năng (metrics comparison). Để đáp ứng yêu cầu khắt khe về Auditing và Compliance Verifications (như truy vết nguồn gốc artifact), SageMaker ML Lineage Tracking là công cụ chuyên sâu và chính xác hơn (nó tạo ra các mối quan hệ liên kết ContributedTo, Produced, DerivedFrom giữa các thực thể).

AWS Compute Optimizer là dịch vụ hoàn toàn tự động, sử dụng Machine Learning để phân tích lịch sử sử dụng (CloudWatch Metrics) của các tài nguyên tính toán (Compute resources). Nó tự động phát hiện các instance bị dư thừa (over-provisioned) hoặc thiếu hụt (under-provisioned) và đưa ra các khuyến nghị cụ thể (ví dụ: \"Đổi từ m5.xlarge xuống m5.large để tiết kiệm $X/tháng\"). Nó hỗ trợ chính xác các tài nguyên được nêu trong đề bài: EC2, Lambda, ECS services (trên Fargate), và EBS volumes. Bạn chỉ cần bật (opt-in) dịch vụ này mà không cần viết bất kỳ dòng code nào.

Tại sao không chọn B (Cost allocation tags): Cost allocation tags giúp bạn phân loại hóa đơn (ví dụ: Chi phí này thuộc về Project A hay Project B) để báo cáo tài chính.

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn C (SageMaker Model Registry): Đề bài yêu cầu tạo một \"central catalog\" (danh mục tập trung) cho các ML models. Khái niệm \"Catalog\" trong ML không chỉ đơn thuần là nơi chứa file (docker image), mà nó cần quản lý siêu dữ liệu (metadata), phiên bản (versioning), trạng thái phê duyệt (approval status - Pending/Approved/Rejected), và lineage. Amazon SageMaker Model Registry là dịch vụ chuyên biệt được thiết kế đúng cho mục đích này. Nó cho phép bạn đăng ký các model (bao gồm cả image nằm trong ECR) vào các \"Model Groups\". Tính năng quan trọng nhất ở đây là Cross-account support: Bạn có thể cấu hình Resource Policy trên các Model Group để cho phép một tài khoản trung tâm (Central Account) truy cập và quản lý metadata của các model nằm rải rác ở các tài khoản khác. Đây là cách chuẩn mực để xây dựng kho quản lý model tập trung (Model Governance) cấp doanh nghiệp. Tại sao không chọn A (ECR Replication): ECR Cross-account replication chỉ đơn giản là copy các Docker images từ tài khoản này sang tài khoản khác. Nó không cung cấp tính năng \"Catalog\" (quản lý phiên bản model, trạng thái phê duyệt, metadata). Việc có hàng đống image nằm ở khắp nơi không giải quyết được bài toán quản trị tập trung. Tại sao không chọn B (New ECR account): Tương tự như A, việc dồn tất cả Docker images về một tài khoản ECR mới chỉ giải quyết vấn đề lưu trữ (Storage), không giải quyết vấn đề quản lý vòng đời model (Model Lifecycle Management). ECR là container registry, không phải là Model Registry. Tại sao không chọn D (AWS Glue Data Catalog): AWS Glue Data Catalog là kho chứa metadata cho dữ liệu (bảng, database, schema) dùng cho ETL và Analytics (Athena, Redshift).

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn A (Production Variants with weight 0.1): Câu hỏi yêu cầu thực hiện xác thực mô hình mới trên 10% lưu lượng truy cập (tương tự Canary Deployment hoặc A/B Testing) với \"chi phí vận hành thấp nhất\". SageMaker Production Variants là tính năng được tích hợp sẵn (native feature), cho phép bạn triển khai nhiều model (variants) đằng sau cùng một Endpoint duy nhất. Bạn kiểm soát lưu lượng truy cập bằng cách gán trọng số (weights) cho từng variant. Để định tuyến 10% traffic vào model mới, bạn chỉ cần cấu hình trọng số (hoặc tỷ lệ) tương ứng (ví dụ: Model cũ = 0.9, Model mới = 0.1). SageMaker sẽ tự động phân phối traffic ngẫu nhiên theo tỷ lệ này mà không cần cấu hình thêm bất kỳ load balancer hay proxy nào bên ngoài. Đây là cách đơn giản và chuẩn mực nhất. Tại sao không chọn B (Weight 1): Nếu đặt trọng số là 1 (trong khi model cũ cũng có trọng số >= 0), traffic sẽ được chia theo tỷ lệ tương ứng của tổng trọng số, nhưng con số \"1\" không đảm bảo chính xác 10% nếu không biết trọng số của model kia. Hơn nữa, nếu tổng trọng số chỉ có model này là 1, nó sẽ nhận 100% traffic, vi phạm yêu cầu đề bài. Tại sao không chọn C (New Endpoint): Tạo một Endpoint hoàn toàn mới đồng nghĩa với việc bạn có hai URL endpoint khác nhau. Để chia traffic (split traffic) giữa hai URL này, bạn sẽ phải cấu hình thêm logic định tuyến phức tạp ở tầng ứng dụng (Application Layer) hoặc Load Balancer, làm tăng chi phí vận hành so với việc dùng tính năng có sẵn của SageMaker. Tại sao không chọn D (ALB routing + CloudTrail): ALB thường định tuyến dựa trên Path hoặc Header. Mặc dù ALB có hỗ trợ weighted target groups, nhưng việc cấu hình nó để trỏ vào SageMaker Endpoint (thường được truy cập qua API invoke của AWS chứ không phải HTTP target thông thường trong VPC theo cách truyền thống) phức tạp hơn. Quan trọng hơn, CloudTrail dùng để audit API calls (quản lý), không phải để monitor số lượng invocations (metrics) thời gian thực hiệu quả như CloudWatch."

Để đảm bảo an toàn cho dữ liệu đang di chuyển (in transit) giữa các container trên các node khác nhau, Amazon SageMaker cung cấp tính năng Inter-container traffic encryption.

Tại sao không chọn D (AWS KMS key for SageMaker domain): Cấu hình KMS cho SageMaker Domain dùng để mã hóa dữ liệu lưu trữ trên ổ đĩa EFS của môi trường làm việc (SageMaker Studio/Notebooks). Nó hoàn toàn không liên quan đến môi trường tính toán tạm thời (ephemeral cluster) được khởi tạo riêng biệt để chạy training job."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn C (RMSE): Dự báo chuỗi thời gian (Time-series forecasting) về bản chất là một bài toán hồi quy (Regression) với yếu tố thời gian. RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) là thước đo tiêu chuẩn để đánh giá độ lệch giữa giá trị dự báo và giá trị thực tế. Nó đo lường độ lớn trung bình của sai số và đặc biệt \"trừng phạt\" nặng các sai số lớn (do bình phương sai số), giúp phát hiện các điểm dự báo sai lệch nghiêm trọng. Tại sao chọn E (Average weighted quantile loss - wQL): Trong các dịch vụ dự báo hiện đại của AWS (như Amazon Forecast hay thuật toán DeepAR), mô hình thường đưa ra dự báo theo xác suất (Probabilistic Forecast) thay vì một điểm đơn lẻ (Point Forecast). wQL được sử dụng để đánh giá độ chính xác của dự báo tại các phân vị cụ thể (ví dụ: P10, P50, P90). Nó đo lường mức độ sai lệch giữa phân phối dự đoán và thực tế, giúp đánh giá rủi ro tốt hơn (ví dụ: dự báo tồn kho quá nhiều hay quá ít). Tại sao không chọn A (Recall): Recall là chỉ số dùng cho bài toán Phân loại (Classification) để đo lường tỷ lệ các mẫu Positive thực tế được dự đoán đúng. Dự báo chuỗi thời gian là dự đoán giá trị liên tục (số lượng, doanh thu), không phải phân loại nhãn. Tại sao không chọn B (LogLoss): LogLoss (hay Cross-entropy Loss) là hàm mất mát dùng cho bài toán Phân loại, đặc biệt là để đánh giá độ tin cậy của xác suất dự đoán lớp (class probability). Nó không áp dụng cho dự báo giá trị số thực. Tại sao không chọn D (InferenceLatency): InferenceLatency (Độ trễ suy luận) là chỉ số về Hiệu năng vận hành (Operational Performance/Efficiency) - tức là model chạy nhanh hay chậm. Khi nói đến \"quality of a model\" trong ngữ cảnh Data Science, người ta thường ám chỉ độ chính xác (Accuracy/Error metrics) của dự đoán, chứ không phải tốc độ phản hồi."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn C (Inference Components): Đây là tính năng mới và mạnh mẽ nhất của SageMaker Real-time Inference, được thiết kế đặc biệt để giải quyết bài toán \"nhiều model trên một endpoint\" nhưng vẫn đảm bảo sự độc lập về tài nguyên. . Accelerated Instances & Cost Efficiency: Inference Components cho phép bạn triển khai nhiều model lên cùng một endpoint (chia sẻ instance GPU đắt tiền) để tối ưu chi phí, thay vì mỗi model một endpoint riêng. . Independent Scaling: Điểm cốt lõi là mỗi \"Inference Component\" có thể có chính sách Auto Scaling riêng biệt. Model A có thể scale lên 5 copies khi tải cao, trong khi Model B vẫn giữ 1 copy. . No Cold Start: Bằng cách đặt tham số \"minimum number of copies\" (số bản sao tối thiểu) là 1 (hoặc lớn hơn), bạn đảm bảo model luôn được tải sẵn trong bộ nhớ GPU/CPU và sẵn sàng phục vụ request ngay lập tức, loại bỏ hoàn toàn vấn đề cold start (độ trễ khi khởi động). Tại sao không chọn A (Serverless Inference): Serverless Inference hiện tại chưa hỗ trợ GPU (accelerated instances). Ngoài ra, mặc dù có Provisioned Concurrency để giảm cold start, nhưng nó không phù hợp với các workload yêu cầu GPU hiệu năng cao như đề bài gợi ý (\"accelerated instances\"). Tại sao không chọn B (Asynchronous Inference): Asynchronous Inference được thiết kế cho các request có thời gian xử lý lâu (long-running) hoặc payload lớn, không phải tối ưu cho \"Real-time responses\" (phản hồi tức thì) với độ trễ thấp nhất. Hơn nữa, Async Inference thường có cơ chế scale-to-zero, dẫn đến cold start nếu không cấu hình kỹ. Tại sao không chọn D (Multi-model Endpoint - MME): Multi-model Endpoint (MME) truyền thống hoạt động theo cơ chế \"Lazy Loading\": model chỉ được tải từ S3 vào bộ nhớ khi có request đầu tiên gọi đến nó. Điều này gây ra Cold Start rõ rệt cho các request đầu tiên. Mặc dù MME tiết kiệm chi phí, nhưng nó vi phạm yêu cầu nghiêm ngặt \"must not allow a cold start\". Ngoài ra, MME scale ở cấp độ Endpoint (Instance level), khó kiểm soát scaling chi tiết cho từng model riên..."

    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn B (MulticlassClassificationEvaluator): Đây là đoạn mã chính xác để đánh giá mô hình phân loại đa lớp (multi-class) trong Spark ML. . Đúng Class Evaluator: Bài toán nêu rõ đây là \"three-class decision tree classifier\" (phân loại 3 lớp), do đó bắt buộc phải sử dụng MulticlassClassificationEvaluator. . Đúng Cấu hình: Các tham số predictionCol=\"prediction\" và labelCol=\"actual\" khớp hoàn toàn với schema của DataFrame preds_df đã cho. Tham số metricName=\"accuracy\" là hợp lệ để tính độ chính xác. . Đúng Phương thức: Quan trọng nhất, đoạn code gọi phương thức .evaluate(preds_df) trên đối tượng evaluator. Đây là bước thực thi tính toán metric dựa trên dữ liệu và trả về kết quả số thực (Double) cho biến accuracy. Tại sao không chọn A (Summarizer): Summarizer trong Spark ML (pyspark.ml.stat) thường được sử dụng để tính toán các thống kê mô tả (như mean, variance, count) cho các cột vector (Vector column summary statistics). Nó không phải là class dùng để đánh giá hiệu năng (evaluation metrics) của mô hình phân loại. Tại sao không chọn C (Missing .evaluate()): Mặc dù Option C khởi tạo đúng đối tượng MulticlassClassificationEvaluator, nhưng nó thiếu bước gọi hàm .evaluate(preds_df). Biến accuracy trong trường hợp này sẽ chỉ chứa đối tượng Evaluator (instance của class), chứ không phải là giá trị độ chính xác (số thực) mà đề bài yêu cầu \"compute the accuracy\". Tại sao không chọn D (BinaryClassificationEvaluator): BinaryClassificationEvaluator chỉ dành riêng cho bài toán phân loại nhị phân (2 lớp). Đề bài nêu rõ đây là bài toán 3 lớp (three-class), nên việc sử dụng Binary Evaluator là sai về mặt kỹ thuật. Hơn nữa, BinaryClassificationEvaluator mặc định hỗ trợ các metric như areaUnderROC hoặc areaUnderPR, chứ không hỗ trợ accuracy một cách trực tiếp như Multiclass Evaluator."

    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn D (SageMaker Savings Plan): Bài toán đưa ra một nhu cầu sử dụng tài nguyên rất rõ ràng và ổn định: chạy training 35 giờ/tuần trong suốt 55 tuần (tương đương hơn 1 năm một chút). Đây là kịch bản hoàn hảo để sử dụng SageMaker Savings Plans. SageMaker Savings Plans cung cấp mức giá chiết khấu đáng kể (lên đến 64%) so với giá On-Demand để đổi lấy cam kết sử dụng một lượng tài nguyên nhất định (tính theo $/giờ) trong kỳ hạn 1 hoặc 3 năm. Với lựa chọn \"1-year term\" và thanh toán \"All Upfront\" (trả trước toàn bộ), công ty sẽ đạt được mức tiết kiệm chi phí tối đa cho khối lượng công việc đã được dự báo trước này. Tại sao không chọn A (Serverless Endpoint): Serverless Endpoint là dịch vụ dành cho Suy luận (Inference), tức là triển khai model để dự đoán. Bạn không thể chạy các công việc Huấn luyện (Training jobs) trên một Inference Endpoint. Đây là sự nhầm lẫn cơ bản về mục đích sử dụng dịch vụ. Tại sao không chọn B (SageMaker Edge Manager): SageMaker Edge Manager được thiết kế để quản lý, giám sát và vận hành các model ML trên các thiết bị biên (Edge devices) như robot, camera thông minh, v.v. Nó không phải là giải pháp để tối ưu hóa chi phí cho việc huấn luyện model trên đám mây (Cloud Training) bằng EC2 instance. Tại sao không chọn C (Heterogeneous cluster): Tính năng Heterogeneous cluster cho phép chạy một training job trên nhiều loại instance khác nhau (ví dụ: dùng CPU instance cho xử lý dữ liệu và GPU instance cho training) để tối ưu hóa hiệu năng. Tuy nhiên, đề bài chỉ đề cập đến việc sử dụng \"a compute optimized instance\" (một loại instance) và tập trung vào khía cạnh tài chính (reduce costs) cho một nhu cầu ổn định dài hạn. Việc thay đổi kiến trúc cluster phức tạp hơn và không đảm bảo giảm chi phí trực tiếp bằng việc cam kết Savings Plan."

Đây chính là định nghĩa của việc giám sát Model Quality Drift và Data Quality Drift. Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor là dịch vụ chuyên dụng được thiết kế để giải quyết chính xác bài toán này. Quy trình chuẩn như sau: . Tạo một Baseline (đường cơ sở) từ thống kê của dữ liệu huấn luyện (Training data statistics & constraints). . Bật tính năng Data Capture trên Endpoint để lưu lại dữ liệu suy luận thực tế. . Lên lịch (Schedule) một monitoring job định kỳ. Job này sẽ tự động so sánh dữ liệu thực tế với Baseline. Nếu phát hiện sự sai lệch vượt quá ngưỡng cho phép (ví dụ: phân phối dữ liệu thay đổi), nó sẽ báo cáo drift và gửi cảnh báo qua CloudWatch.

Đây chính là bài toán phát hiện Bias (Thiên kiến). Amazon SageMaker Clarify là công cụ chuyên dụng được tích hợp trong SageMaker để thực hiện nhiệm vụ này. Nó có khả năng: . Pre-training bias metrics: Phân tích dữ liệu trước khi huấn luyện để tìm sự mất cân bằng đại diện (ví dụ: dữ liệu về một nhóm tuổi quá ít). . Post-training bias metrics: Phân tích kết quả dự đoán sau khi huấn luyện để xem model có đối xử bất công với các nhóm cụ thể hay không (ví dụ: tỷ lệ từ chối vay vốn cao bất thường ở một nhóm dân tộc). . Explainability: Giải thích lý do tại sao model đưa ra dự đoán đó (Feature attribution). Tại sao không chọn A (Amazon CloudWatch): CloudWatch là dịch vụ giám sát hạ tầng và hiệu năng vận hành (Operational monitoring).

Rolling Deployment (Triển khai cuốn chiếu) là chiến lược duy nhất phù hợp trong trường hợp này. Với RollingBatchSize = 1, SageMaker sẽ thực hiện quy trình sau: . Khởi tạo 1 instance mới (sử dụng RI thứ 11) chạy phiên bản model mới. . Sau khi instance này sẵn sàng, nó sẽ định tuyến traffic vào đó và tắt 1 instance cũ đi (trả lại 1 slot RI). . Lặp lại quy trình này 10 lần cho đến khi toàn bộ fleet được cập nhật. Cách này đảm bảo số lượng instance hoạt động không bao giờ vượt quá 11, tận dụng đúng số lượng RIs đã mua mà vẫn đảm bảo không có thời gian chết (no downtime). Tại sao không chọn A và B (Blue/Green Deployment): Blue/Green Deployment (dù là all-at-once hay canary) hoạt động theo nguyên tắc tạo ra một môi trường mới (Green Fleet) hoàn toàn độc lập và song song với môi trường cũ (Blue Fleet) trước khi chuyển traffic. Với 10 instance đang chạy, Blue/Green sẽ yêu cầu khởi tạo thêm 10 instance mới nữa (Tổng cộng 20 instances) để sẵn sàng chuyển đổi. Do công ty chỉ có thêm 1 RI, việc provision thêm 10 instance sẽ dẫn đến việc phải dùng On- Demand instance (tốn kém) hoặc không đủ quota/capacity, vi phạm ràng buộc về việc sử dụng tài nguyên đã nêu. Tại sao không chọn C (Shadow test): Shadow Testing là kỹ thuật kiểm thử, không phải chiến lược triển khai thay thế (replacement strategy). Nó gửi bản sao của traffic sang một \"Shadow variant\" để so sánh hiệu năng mà không trả kết quả cho user. Việc này vừa không hoàn thành mục tiêu \"deploy new version\" để phục vụ user, vừa tiêu tốn tài nguyên gấp đôi (nếu shadow 100% traffic) hoặc phức tạp hóa hạ tầng không cần thiết."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn B (Private subnets + S3 VPC Endpoint): Để đạt được yêu cầu \"network isolation from the internet\" (cô lập mạng hoàn toàn khỏi internet), các SageMaker training jobs phải chạy trong Private Subnet (không có đường ra Internet Gateway). Tuy nhiên, SageMaker vẫn cần truy cập dữ liệu training nằm trên S3. S3 Gateway VPC Endpoint là giải pháp chuẩn để cho phép các tài nguyên trong Private Subnet truy cập S3 qua mạng nội bộ của AWS mà không cần đi qua internet công cộng (public internet). Đây là kiến trúc tối ưu cho bảo mật và cô lập mạng. Tại sao không chọn A (NAT gateway): NAT Gateway được thiết kế để cung cấp khả năng truy cập internet chiều đi (outbound) cho các tài nguyên trong Private Subnet (ví dụ: để tải gói tin, update phần mềm). Việc sử dụng NAT Gateway đồng nghĩa với việc mở kết nối ra internet, điều này vi phạm yêu cầu \"network isolation from the internet\" (cô lập khỏi internet) của đề bài. Tại sao không chọn C (Public subnets): Việc chạy training jobs trong Public Subnets yêu cầu tài nguyên phải có địa chỉ Public IP và Internet Gateway để giao tiếp. Dù có dùng Security Group để hạn chế, về mặt kiến trúc mạng, tài nguyên này vẫn nằm trên mạng công cộng, vi phạm hoàn toàn yêu cầu về cô lập mạng (network isolation). Tại sao không chọn D (Encryption/SecureTransport): Đáp án này chỉ tập trung vào bảo mật dữ liệu (mã hóa đường truyền và mã hóa lưu trữ) mà không giải quyết vấn đề về kiến trúc mạng. Việc bật aws:SecureTransport (HTTPS) hay mã hóa dữ liệu không ngăn chặn việc training jobs kết nối ra internet hoặc đảm bảo traffic đi qua đường truyền riêng tư."

Mặc dù container là một phần của quá trình triển khai, nhưng ECR không quản lý \"phiên bản mô hình\" (model artifacts + metrics + status) theo ngữ cảnh ML. Nó chỉ quản lý phiên bản của image (tag). Tại sao không chọn B (SageMaker Marketplace): Đây là một \"chợ ứng dụng\" để tìm kiếm, mua hoặc bán các mô hình và thuật toán từ bên thứ ba (third-party vendors), không phải là công cụ để quản lý phiên bản cho các mô hình nội bộ của công ty.

    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn D (Knowledge base for Amazon Bedrock): Đây là giải pháp \"Managed RAG\" (RAG được quản lý hoàn toàn) của AWS. Tính năng Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock tự động hóa toàn bộ quy trình RAG: từ việc kết nối nguồn dữ liệu (S3), chia nhỏ văn bản (chunking), tạo vector (embedding), lưu trữ vào vector database và truy xuất (retrieval). Vì AWS xử lý mọi công đoạn phức tạp ở backend, đây là giải pháp có \"LEAST operational overhead\" (ít gánh nặng vận hành nhất). Tại sao không chọn A (SageMaker Pipelines/New model): Phương án này đề cập đến việc tạo hoặc train một model mới. RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) là kỹ thuật bổ sung dữ liệu ngoài vào prompt, không phải là quy trình training model mới. Hơn nữa, việc quản lý pipeline training rất tốn kém chi phí vận hành. Tại sao không chọn B (Manual Vectorization + Neptune): Mặc dù kiến trúc này khả thi về mặt kỹ thuật, nhưng nó yêu cầu bạn phải tự viết code để chuyển đổi dữ liệu sang vector, sau đó tự cấu hình và quản lý cơ sở dữ liệu Amazon Neptune. Việc tự quản lý (self-managed) các thành phần này tạo ra gánh nặng vận hành cao hơn nhiều so với giải pháp tích hợp sẵn (Option D). Tại sao không chọn C (Fine-tune + AutoML): Fine-tuning (tinh chỉnh) khác hoàn toàn với RAG. Fine-tuning là dạy model học dữ liệu mới để thay đổi trọng số (weights), trong khi RAG là tra cứu thông tin tại thời điểm chạy (runtime). Ngoài ra, Fine-tuning yêu cầu chuẩn bị dữ liệu phức tạp và tốn kém tài nguyên tính toán hơn nhiều."

    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn B (Asynchronous inference): Đây là chế độ suy luận được thiết kế đặc biệt cho các request có payload lớn (lên đến 1 GB) và thời gian xử lý lâu (lên đến 1 giờ). o Đề bài yêu cầu xử lý payload từ 100 MB - 300 MB (vượt xa giới hạn của Real- time) và thời gian xử lý lên đến 60 phút. Asynchronous Inference hoạt động bằng cách đưa request vào hàng đợi (queue) và xử lý không đồng bộ, hoàn toàn phù hợp với các thông số này. Tại sao không chọn A (Serverless inference): Chế độ Serverless có giới hạn payload rất thấp (tối đa 4 MB cho request body) và giới hạn thời gian xử lý (timeout) chỉ là 60 giây. Không thể xử lý file 100 MB hay chạy trong 60 phút. Tại sao không chọn C (Real-time inference): Chế độ Real-time được tối ưu cho độ trễ thấp (mili giây). Nó có giới hạn payload là 6 MB và timeout mặc định là 60 giây. Nếu gửi 100 MB vào Real-time endpoint, request sẽ bị từ chối ngay lập tức (413 Request Entity Too Large). Tại sao không chọn D (Batch transform): Mặc dù Batch Transform xử lý được dữ liệu lớn, nhưng đề bài yêu cầu triển khai trên một SageMaker Endpoint (\"deploy... on an Amazon SageMaker endpoint\"). Batch Transform không sử dụng endpoint thường trực mà là chạy các jobs xử lý hàng loạt offline (khởi tạo, xử lý, rồi tắt).

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn C (Random oversampling): Đây là kỹ thuật kinh điển để xử lý vấn đề mất cân bằng dữ liệu (Class Imbalance). Random Oversampling hoạt động bằng cách nhân bản ngẫu nhiên các mẫu dữ liệu thuộc lớp thiểu số (minority class) cho đến khi số lượng của nó cân bằng với lớp đa số (majority class). Điều này giúp mô hình học được các đặc trưng của lớp thiểu số tốt hơn thay vì bị thiên vị về phía lớp đa số. Tại sao không chọn A (Reduce the size): Việc giảm kích thước tập dữ liệu một cách chung chung (không nói rõ là giảm lớp đa số - Undersampling) sẽ làm mất mát thông tin quan trọng và có thể dẫn đến việc mô hình hoạt động kém (underfitting) mà không nhất thiết giải quyết được tỷ lệ mất cân bằng. Tại sao không chọn B (Transform images): \"Transform\" ám chỉ kỹ thuật Data Augmentation (xoay, cắt, lật ảnh). Mặc dù Augmentation thường được dùng kết hợp với Oversampling để tạo ra các biến thể mới cho lớp thiểu số (tránh overfitting), nhưng bản thân hành động \"biến đổi một số ảnh\" không trực tiếp giải quyết vấn đề về số lượng/tỷ lệ chênh lệch giữa các lớp nếu không được thực hiện với mục đích tăng số lượng mẫu thiểu số cụ thể. Option C là định nghĩa trực tiếp của giải pháp. Tại sao không chọn D (Random data splitting): Đây là bước chia dữ liệu thành các tập Train/Validation/Test. Việc chia ngẫu nhiên (Random splitting) thậm chí còn có thể làm vấn đề tồi tệ hơn nếu lớp thiểu số quá ít và không xuất hiện trong tập Validation/Test. Để xử lý imbalance khi chia dữ liệu, người ta dùng Stratified Splitting (chia theo tỷ lệ tầng), nhưng nó chỉ đảm bảo phân phối đều giữa các tập con chứ không sửa lỗi mất cân bằng trong chính dữ liệu training."

Tính năng \"Sensitive Data Detection\" được tích hợp sẵn trong Glue cho phép tự động nhận diện các loại dữ liệu nhạy cảm (PII) như số thẻ tín dụng và thực hiện hành động thay thế (masking/redaction) ngay trong luồng xử lý dữ liệu. Vì đây là tính năng có sẵn (built- in transform), bạn chỉ cần cấu hình mà không cần viết code xử lý phức tạp, đáp ứng hoàn hảo yêu cầu \"LEAST development effort\" (ít nỗ lực phát triển nhất). Tại sao không chọn A (Amazon Macie): Amazon Macie là dịch vụ bảo mật và khám phá dữ liệu (Discovery & Classification). Macie quét S3 để phát hiện và báo cáo dữ liệu nhạy cảm, nhưng nó KHÔNG phải là công cụ ETL để thực hiện hành động biến đổi (masking/redacting) dữ liệu trực tiếp trong file để phục vụ quy trình training tiếp theo. Tại sao không chọn C (AWS Glue + Custom Regex): Mặc dù vẫn dùng AWS Glue, nhưng việc phải tự viết code Apache Spark và duy trì các biểu thức chính quy (Regex) để khớp đúng định dạng thẻ tín dụng đòi hỏi nỗ lực phát triển và kiểm thử cao hơn nhiều so với việc dùng tính năng có sẵn (Option B). Ngoài ra, Regex tự viết dễ bị sai sót (false negatives) so với thư viện chuẩn của AWS. Tại sao không chọn D (EC2 + Custom Spark): Đây là giải pháp \"tự quản lý\" (Self- managed).

Vì đề bài yêu cầu \"gain insight\" từ hồ sơ sức khỏe với \"LEAST development effort\" (ít nỗ lực phát triển nhất), việc gọi một API có sẵn chuyên cho y tế là tối ưu nhất. Tại sao không chọn A (RNN with SageMaker): Việc xây dựng một mạng nơ-ron hồi quy (RNN) từ đầu đòi hỏi chuyên môn sâu về Data Science, chuẩn bị dữ liệu lớn, training, tuning và deployment.

Tại sao không chọn C (Textract + Comprehend): Mặc dù đây là một pattern hợp lệ (dùng Textract để OCR rồi đưa text vào Comprehend), nhưng nó yêu cầu bạn phải quản lý hai dịch vụ riêng biệt và viết code để nối (glue code) output của Textract vào input của Comprehend. Điều này tốn nhiều thời gian thiết lập hơn so với tính năng native của Option A.

    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn A (Comprehend + S3): o Amazon Comprehend DetectPiiEntities: Là dịch vụ chuyên biệt sử dụng NLP để phát hiện và xác định vị trí các thực thể PII (tên, địa chỉ, số thẻ...) trong văn bản. Nó cung cấp thông tin chính xác để thực hiện việc che giấu (redaction) dữ liệu trước khi training. o Amazon S3: Là chuẩn lưu trữ (de facto standard) cho dữ liệu training của SageMaker. S3 tích hợp natively với SageMaker (qua File Mode hoặc Pipe Mode), rẻ hơn EFS và dễ dàng quản lý vòng đời dữ liệu. o Operational Efficiency: Việc kết hợp khả năng phát hiện mạnh mẽ của Comprehend và lưu trữ chuẩn S3 mang lại quy trình mượt mà và ít tốn công vận hành nhất so với việc phải quản lý mount điểm EFS hay dùng Macie (chỉ discovery). Tại sao không chọn B (Comprehend + EFS): o Mặc dù phần xử lý PII giống A, nhưng việc sử dụng Amazon EFS làm kho lưu trữ chính cho training data thường phức tạp hơn S3. EFS cần cấu hình VPC, Mount Targets, và gắn (mount) vào instance. Trừ khi cần chia sẻ file hệ thống trực tiếp hoặc huấn luyện phân tán đặc thù, S3 luôn là lựa chọn mặc định và hiệu quả hơn cho SageMaker. Tại sao không chọn C (Glue DataBrew + EFS): o Glue DataBrew là công cụ trực quan để làm sạch dữ liệu, có thể xử lý PII. Tuy nhiên, việc kết hợp với EFS lại làm giảm tính hiệu quả vận hành (như lý do ở B). Ngoài ra, đối với dữ liệu văn bản phi cấu trúc cần NLP để nhận diện ngữ cảnh PII, Comprehend thường vượt trội hơn các quy tắc transformation cố định của DataBrew. Tại sao không chọn D (Macie + S3): o Amazon Macie chủ yếu là công cụ bảo mật và tuân thủ (Security & Compliance) dùng để quét và báo cáo dữ liệu nhạy cảm đang nằm yên trong S3. Nó không phải là công cụ tiền xử lý (preprocessing tool) để redact (xóa/che) dữ liệu và tạo ra dataset sạch mới cho training pipeline một cách trực tiếp như Comprehend. Macie thiên về \"phát hiện rủi ro\" hơn là \"chuẩn bị dữ liệu\"."

    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn A (Lifecycle configuration): Đây là tính năng nguyên bản (native) của Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instances, được thiết kế chuyên biệt để tự động hóa việc chạy các script tùy chỉnh (shell scripts) tại hai thời điểm: khi tạo mới (OnCreate) hoặc khi khởi động lại (OnStart). Bạn chỉ cần upload script một lần và chọn nó khi tạo notebook. Đây là giải pháp đơn giản nhất, không cần quản lý thêm hạ tầng hay dịch vụ bên ngoài, đáp ứng hoàn hảo tiêu chí \"LEAST operational overhead\". Tại sao không chọn B (Custom ECR image): Việc tạo và duy trì một Docker Image tùy chỉnh (build, push lên ECR, versioning) chỉ để chạy một script cài đặt là quá phức tạp và tốn công sức (Overkill). Giải pháp này thường dùng khi bạn cần thay đổi sâu vào môi trường (OS, drivers) hoặc dùng cho SageMaker Studio/Training Jobs, không phải là cách tối ưu cho việc cài script đơn giản trên Notebook Instance. Tại sao không chọn C (AWS CodeArtifact): CodeArtifact là dịch vụ quản lý gói phụ thuộc (artifact/package repository như PyPI, Maven private). Nó dùng để lưu trữ thư viện, không phải là công cụ để thực thi script cấu hình hệ thống (bootstrapping) khi khởi tạo máy ảo. Tại sao không chọn D (Lambda + EventBridge): Đây là giải pháp \"tự chế\" (custom orchestration). Bạn phải thiết lập EventBridge để bắt sự kiện tạo notebook, kích hoạt Lambda, và Lambda phải tìm cách kết nối vào Notebook (thường qua SSM) để chạy lệnh. Kiến trúc này quá phức tạp, dễ lỗi và khó bảo trì so với tính năng Lifecycle Config có sẵn."

    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn D (Amazon MSK + Managed Flink): o Real-time & High Volume: Amazon MSK (Kafka) là tiêu chuẩn công nghiệp cho việc ingesting (nạp) lượng dữ liệu clickstream khổng lồ với độ trễ thấp. o SQL & Interactive Analysis: Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink (trước đây là Kinesis Data Analytics) cung cấp tính năng \"Studio\". Tính năng này cho phép bạn chạy SQL queries trực tiếp trên luồng dữ liệu (streaming data) theo thời gian thực. o Notebooks: Flink Studio cung cấp giao diện Notebook (dựa trên Apache Zeppelin, nhưng thường được đánh đồng với trải nghiệm \"interactive notebook\" trong các bài thi) để Data Scientist/Engineer có thể viết code, chạy SQL và xem kết quả trực quan (visualize) ngay lập tức trên dòng dữ liệu đang chạy mà không cần chờ lưu xuống đĩa. Đây là giải pháp tối ưu nhất cho yêu cầu \"Interactive analysis\" trên dữ liệu Streaming. Tại sao không chọn A (Firehose + Lambda): AWS Lambda là dịch vụ tính toán dựa trên sự kiện (Event-driven compute), sử dụng code (Python, Node.js...) chứ không phải SQL native cho việc xử lý dữ liệu (mặc dù có thể viết code để chạy SQL, nhưng không phải là công cụ \"Supports SQL\" theo nghĩa của đề bài). Hơn nữa, Lambda không cung cấp giao diện \"Jupyter notebooks\" để phân tích tương tác. Tại sao không chọn B (Athena): Amazon Athena là công cụ truy vấn tương tác cho dữ liệu đã lưu trữ (Data at Rest) trên S3. Nó không phải là công cụ xử lý luồng thời gian thực (Real-time Stream Processing). Độ trễ từ lúc dữ liệu vào Kinesis -> Firehose -> S3 -> Athena query là quá cao so với yêu cầu \"Real-time processing\". Tại sao không chọn C (Glue + PySpark): Mặc dù AWS Glue có hỗ trợ Streaming ETL và Jupyter Notebooks, nhưng Glue thường hoạt động theo cơ chế Micro-batch (của Spark Streaming) nên độ trễ thường cao hơn Flink (Native Streaming). Ngoài ra, Glue thường thiên về các job ETL (Trích xuất - Biến đổi - Tải) nặng nề hơn là việc \"Interactive Analysis\" (Phân tích tương tác) nhanh chóng trên luồng dữ liệu như Flink Studio."

    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn B (Custom Docker Container): Đây là phương pháp chuẩn (Best Practice) để quản lý các thư viện tùy chỉnh trong môi trường ML công nghiệp (ML Pipelines). o Tính nhất quán (Consistency): Bằng cách đóng gói thư viện vào Docker Image, bạn đảm bảo môi trường chạy Processing, Training và Pipeline là hoàn toàn giống nhau, tránh lỗi \"works on my machine\". o Hiệu năng: Thư viện được cài sẵn trong image, không tốn thời gian cài đặt lại mỗi khi job chạy (khác với việc pip install tại runtime). o Khả năng mở rộng: Dễ dàng chia sẻ và tái sử dụng image này qua ECR cho nhiều project khác nhau. Tại sao không chọn A (Manually install): \"Cài đặt thủ công\" (thường ám chỉ việc chạy lệnh pip install ngay trong code training hoặc script entrypoint) có nhiều nhược điểm: o Tăng thời gian khởi động job (Latency) vì phải tải và cài thư viện mỗi lần chạy. o Yêu cầu kết nối Internet (rủi ro bảo mật). o Dễ gặp lỗi version xung đột tại thời điểm chạy (Runtime errors). Tại sao không chọn C (Notebook Instance + Lambda): Đây là hiểu sai cơ bản về kiến trúc SageMaker. Các SageMaker Jobs (Training, Processing) chạy trên các cụm máy chủ tính toán (compute clusters) tạm thời, tách biệt hoàn toàn với Notebook Instance. Việc cài thư viện lên Notebook Instance không hề ảnh hưởng hay cung cấp thư viện cho môi trường chạy Job. Tại sao không chọn D (External EC2): Việc chạy code trên EC2 thủ công là đi ngược lại lợi ích của SageMaker (Managed Service).

    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn C (SageMaker Model Monitor): Đây là dịch vụ chuyên dụng để giám sát chất lượng dữ liệu (Data Quality) và sự trôi dạt (Data Drift/Concept Drift) cho các mô hình đã triển khai trên Production. o Cơ chế: Model Monitor tự động so sánh dữ liệu đầu vào thực tế (captured data) với một tập dữ liệu cơ sở (baseline statistics). Nếu phát hiện sự sai lệch (ví dụ: tỉ lệ null cao, sai kiểu dữ liệu, thay đổi phân phối), nó sẽ đẩy các metrics vi phạm lên Amazon CloudWatch. o Alerting: Từ CloudWatch, bạn có thể cấu hình Alarm để gửi thông báo (alerts) khi các metrics này vượt ngưỡng. Tại sao không chọn A (CloudWatch metric alarm only): CloudWatch Alarm cần một nguồn metrics đầu vào. Bản thân CloudWatch chỉ đo các chỉ số hạ tầng (CPU, Memory, Latency) chứ không thể tự \"đọc\" nội dung dữ liệu ML để biết chất lượng tốt hay xấu. Nó cần Model Monitor (Option C) làm bước trung gian để phân tích dữ liệu và gửi metrics. Tại sao không chọn B (SageMaker Clarify): SageMaker Clarify tập trung vào việc phát hiện thiên kiến (Bias) và giải thích mô hình (Explainability). Mặc dù Model Monitor có sử dụng Clarify ở backend cho tính năng Bias Drift, nhưng để giám sát chung về \"Data Quality\" (như schema validation, completeness), thuật ngữ chính xác và dịch vụ bao trùm nhất là Model Monitor.

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn D (S3 Fast File Mode with S3 Standard): o Tối ưu chi phí: Dữ liệu hiện đang nằm trên S3 Standard (rẻ nhất cho lưu trữ nóng). Fast File Mode (FFM) cho phép container training truy cập dữ liệu trực tiếp dưới dạng file hệ thống (POSIX) mà không cần tải toàn bộ dữ liệu về ổ đĩa cục bộ (EBS) của instance. Điều này giúp loại bỏ thời gian chờ tải dữ liệu (startup time) và tiết kiệm chi phí dung lượng EBS. o Phù hợp với đặc thù file: Với kích thước file trung bình ~200 MB, FFM hoạt động rất hiệu quả (vì ít tốn chi phí overhead cho metadata requests so với hàng triệu file nhỏ). o Không tốn phí hạ tầng phụ: Không cần khởi tạo và trả tiền cho file system phụ trợ như FSx hay EFS. Tại sao không chọn A (Amazon EFS): Amazon EFS có chi phí lưu trữ cao hơn nhiều so với S3 Standard (khoảng gấp 10 lần). Ngoài ra, EFS thường được dùng khi cần chia sẻ trạng thái hoặc code giữa các instance, không phải là lựa chọn tối ưu về giá cho việc stream dữ liệu training tĩnh cỡ lớn (throughput cost cao). Tại sao không chọn B (Amazon FSx for Lustre): FSx for Lustre cung cấp hiệu năng cực cao (throughput lớn, latency thấp), giúp tăng tốc training. Tuy nhiên, nó yêu cầu bạn phải trả tiền cho một hệ thống file riêng biệt (dung lượng + throughput). Với yêu cầu \"MOST cost-effective\" (tiết kiệm nhất) và kích thước 300GB, chi phí tăng thêm của FSx thường không bù đắp được bằng việc giảm thời gian training so với giải pháp \"free\" là FFM. Tại sao không chọn C (S3 Express One Zone): S3 Express One Zone là lớp lưu trữ hiệu năng cao (single-AZ) với độ trễ cực thấp, nhưng giá lưu trữ của nó đắt hơn nhiều so với S3 Standard (khoảng gấp 7 lần). Việc di chuyển dữ liệu sang lớp này chỉ để training sẽ làm tăng đáng kể chi phí lưu trữ mà không cần thiết cho kịch bản này."

    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn C (Shadow Variant): o Shadow Deployment (Shadow Mode) là tính năng được SageMaker hỗ trợ sẵn, cho phép bạn triển khai mô hình mới (Shadow model) song song với mô hình hiện tại (Production model) trên cùng một Endpoint. o Nó sẽ tự động sao chép (mirror) traffic thực tế gửi tới Production model sang Shadow model để chạy thử nghiệm. Kết quả trả về cho user vẫn là của Production model, nhưng bạn sẽ thu thập được metrics (latency, error rate, prediction) của Shadow model để so sánh hiệu năng. o Đây là giải pháp có \"LEAST operational effort\" vì SageMaker lo toàn bộ việc điều phối traffic, logging và so sánh mà không ảnh hưởng đến người dùng cuối. Tại sao không chọn A (Separate endpoint + Manual split): Việc triển khai ra endpoint riêng và tự chia traffic thủ công (ở phía client/application code) đòi hỏi bạn phải sửa đổi code ứng dụng, quản lý logic cân bằng tải, và tự thu thập/so sánh metrics từ 2 endpoint khác nhau. Rủi ro và công sức vận hành cao hơn nhiều. Tại sao không chọn B (CloudFront): Amazon CloudFront là CDN (Content Delivery Network), thường dùng để phân phối nội dung tĩnh hoặc cache API. Mặc dù CloudFront Functions/Lambda@Edge có thể chia traffic, nhưng việc thiết lập nó để routing request tới 2 SageMaker Endpoints (vốn nằm trong VPC hoặc yêu cầu SigV4 signing phức tạp) là giải pháp rất cồng kềnh (High complexity) và không phải là pattern chuẩn cho ML Model A/B Testing. Tại sao không chọn D (Lambda routing): Tương tự như B, việc dựng một hàm Lambda đứng trước để làm \"Router\" đòi hỏi bạn phải viết code custom logic để chia traffic, xử lý retry, timeout và monitor. Đây là việc \"reinventing the wheel\" (phát minh lại bánh xe) khi SageMaker đã có sẵn tính năng này."

Để tuân thủ quy tắc \"prohibit the collection of aggregated metadata\", AWS cung cấp cơ chế Opt-out (thông qua AWS Organizations AI services opt-out policies). o Khi bạn chọn \"Opt out\", AWS sẽ ngừng lưu trữ hoặc sử dụng dữ liệu đào tạo và metadata của bạn cho mục đích cải thiện sản phẩm của họ. Đây là giải pháp trực tiếp nhất để đáp ứng yêu cầu về \"compliance rules\" liên quan đến việc thu thập metadata. Tại sao không chọn B (Private subnet): Chạy trong Private Subnet giúp cô lập kết nối mạng (Network Isolation) để job không truy cập Internet.

    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn Classification evaluation cho \"Categorize customer reviews...\": Yêu cầu ở đây là gán nhãn (labeling) cho văn bản vào các nhóm rời rạc đã định trước (Positive, Neutral, Negative). Trong thuật ngữ Machine Learning và NLP, việc xác định cảm xúc (Sentiment Analysis) chính là bài toán Classification (Phân loại văn bản).

Tại sao chọn Text summarization cho \"Create concise product descriptions...\": Từ khóa \"concise\" (ngắn gọn) và \"from complete details\" (từ chi tiết đầy đủ) mô tả chính xác quá trình tóm tắt văn bản. Task Text summarization đo lường khả năng của model trong việc chắt lọc thông tin quan trọng từ văn bản dài thành văn bản ngắn hơn mà vẫn giữ được ý nghĩa cốt lõi. Tại sao chọn Question answering cho \"Respond to specific customer queries...\": Hành động \"Respond to queries\" (Trả lời truy vấn) về tính năng sản phẩm là định nghĩa cơ bản của bài toán Question Answering (QA). Trong FMEval, task này đánh giá khả năng model trả lời chính xác câu hỏi dựa trên kiến thức đã học hoặc ngữ cảnh được cung cấp (RAG). Tại sao chọn Open-ended generation cho \"Recommend products...\": Đây là lựa chọn cuối cùng và cũng là task trừu tượng nhất.

Không giống như classification (chọn 1 nhãn) hay QA (trả lời fact), việc gợi ý đòi hỏi model sáng tạo ra một danh sách hoặc đoạn văn bản thuyết phục người dùng, do đó nó phù hợp nhất với nhóm Open-ended generation."

    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn A (SageMaker JumpStart): Để triển khai một mô hình mã nguồn mở (Open Source LLM) phổ biến với chi phí vận hành thấp nhất, SageMaker JumpStart là giải pháp tối ưu. Nó cung cấp một \"Model Zoo\" với các mô hình đã được đóng gói sẵn (như Llama, Falcon, Mistral). Bạn có thể triển khai chúng lên SageMaker Endpoint chỉ bằng vài cú click chuột (hoặc vài dòng code) mà không cần tự xây dựng Docker container hay lo lắng về việc tối ưu hóa model server. Tại sao chọn E (Amazon Lex): Để tạo giao diện tương tác người dùng (UI/Conversational Interface) với ít nỗ lực nhất, Amazon Lex là dịch vụ được quản lý hoàn toàn (fully managed) dành cho chatbot. Thay vì phải tự code và duy trì hệ thống WebSocket, API Gateway và Frontend (như Option C), Amazon Lex cung cấp sẵn khung sườn cho hội thoại, quản lý phiên (session management) và tích hợp dễ dàng với các kênh chat hoặc web client (thông qua Amazon Lex Web UI). Bạn chỉ cần cấu hình Lex để gọi Lambda, và Lambda sẽ gọi SageMaker Endpoint để lấy câu trả lời từ LLM. Tại sao không chọn B (EC2 manual deployment): Việc tự tải model và cài đặt trên EC2 yêu cầu bạn phải quản lý hệ điều hành, driver GPU (CUDA), bản vá bảo mật và tự xây dựng cơ chế auto-scaling. Đây là phương án có gánh nặng vận hành (Operational Overhead) cao nhất (Self-managed). Tại sao không chọn C (Custom Frontend + API Gateway + Lambda): Mặc dù đây là kiến trúc Serverless phổ biến, nhưng việc phải tự xây dựng (build) và duy trì mã nguồn cho Frontend HTML, cấu hình WebSocket API và logic Lambda để xử lý kết nối đòi hỏi nỗ lực phát triển và vận hành lớn hơn nhiều so với việc sử dụng dịch vụ Chatbot có sẵn như Lex. Tại sao không chọn D (Amazon QuickSight): Amazon QuickSight là công cụ Business Intelligence (BI) dùng để vẽ biểu đồ và phân tích dữ liệu. Mặc dù có tính năng Generative Q, nhưng nó không phải là nền tảng để host một giao diện chat tùy chỉnh cho một model LLM mã nguồn mở bất kỳ."

    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn D (Kinesis Data Streams + Managed Flink + DynamoDB): Đây là kiến trúc tiêu chuẩn (Standard Reference Architecture) cho các ứng dụng phân tích dữ liệu thời gian thực (Real-time Analytics) với lưu lượng lớn trên AWS. o Ingestion: Amazon Kinesis Data Streams được thiết kế chuyên biệt để xử lý dữ liệu streaming với thông lượng cao (high throughput). Với khối lượng 5 GB/phút (~85 MB/s), Kinesis có thể dễ dàng mở rộng bằng cách tăng số lượng Shard. o Transformation: Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink là dịch vụ xử lý luồng (stream processing) có độ trễ cực thấp (sub-second latency), hỗ trợ stateful processing (xử lý có trạng thái) để thực hiện các phép biến đổi phức tạp trên cửa sổ thời gian (windowing). o Storage: Amazon DynamoDB là cơ sở dữ liệu NoSQL có khả năng chịu tải ghi cực lớn (high write throughput) và trả về kết quả truy vấn với độ trễ mili giây (millisecond latency), đáp ứng hoàn hảo yêu cầu \"fast queries for real- time analytics\". Tại sao không chọn A (EventBridge + Glue + ElastiCache): Amazon EventBridge là dịch vụ định tuyến sự kiện (Event Bus) cho kiến trúc hướng sự kiện, không phải là đường ống dẫn dữ liệu (Data Pipeline) cho khối lượng dữ liệu streaming lớn (5 GB/phút). Ngoài ra, ElastiCache (Memcached) là bộ nhớ đệm (caching) tạm thời, không phải là nơi lưu trữ bền vững chính (primary data store) cho ứng dụng analytics. Tại sao không chọn B (SQS + Lambda + S3): Amazon S3 là kho lưu trữ đối tượng (Object Storage), thường dùng cho Data Lake. Mặc dù S3 bền vững, nhưng độ trễ khi truy vấn dữ liệu từ S3 (ví dụ dùng Athena) thường tính bằng giây hoặc phút, không đáp ứng được yêu cầu \"fast queries for real-time analytics\" (thường cần ms). Ngoài ra, mô hình SQS + Lambda khó xử lý các bài toán phân tích luồng phức tạp (như sliding windows) so với Flink.

    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn D (AWS KMS + Encryption CLI): o AWS KMS (Key Management Service): Là dịch vụ chuyên biệt để tạo và quản lý các khóa mã hóa. Tính năng quan trọng nhất của KMS là Key Policy (Chính sách khóa), cho phép bạn định nghĩa chính xác \"ai\" (User, Role, Application) được phép sử dụng khóa này để mã hóa hoặc giải mã.

Tại sao không chọn A (SSH access key): SSH Keys được dùng để xác thực quyền truy cập vào máy chủ (như EC2) qua giao thức SSH. Chúng không phải là khóa mật mã dùng để mã hóa dữ liệu (Data Encryption). Tại sao không chọn B (API Gateway API Key): API Keys trong API Gateway được dùng để định danh và kiểm soát hạn ngạch (throttling/quota) cho người gọi API. Chúng không có chức năng mã hóa dữ liệu.

Nó hỗ trợ cả Online Store (độ trễ thấp cho inference) và Offline Store (cho training). o SageMaker Feature Processing là một khả năng tích hợp sẵn của Feature Store, cho phép bạn định nghĩa các quy trình chuyển đổi dữ liệu (thường sử dụng Apache Spark/PySpark) để thực hiện feature engineering và aggregation. Nó tự động tải (ingest) dữ liệu đã xử lý vào Feature Store. Đây là giải pháp trọn gói (end-to-end) chuẩn nhất trong hệ sinh thái SageMaker cho bài toán này. Tại sao không chọn B (Model Monitor + S3): o SageMaker Model Monitor được dùng để giám sát mô hình đã triển khai (deployed models) nhằm phát hiện data drift hoặc model drift. Nó không phải là công cụ ETL để thực hiện feature engineering hay aggregation cho dữ liệu thô ban đầu. o Lưu trữ JSON trên S3 thiếu các tính năng quản lý đặc trưng chuyên sâu (như time travel, feature serving low-latency) mà Feature Store cung cấp.

Real-time Endpoint duy trì các instance luôn chạy sẵn (persistent/warm instances), đảm bảo không có độ trễ khởi động (cold start), đáp ứng hoàn hảo yêu cầu \"minimize response-time latency\". Tại sao không chọn A (Batch transform): Batch Transform dùng để xử lý offline hàng loạt dữ liệu lớn (ví dụ: chạy dự đoán cho toàn bộ khách hàng vào ban đêm). Nó không hỗ trợ tương tác thời gian thực với người dùng đang online. Tại sao không chọn C (Serverless inference): Serverless Inference có thể gặp vấn đề \"Cold Start\" (thời gian khởi động nguội) nếu endpoint không được gọi trong một khoảng thời gian, gây ra độ trễ cao đột ngột cho request đầu tiên. Do đó, nó không phải là lựa chọn tốt nhất nếu mục tiêu tối thượng là \"minimize response-time latency\" một cách ổn định. Tại sao không chọn D (Asynchronous inference): Asynchronous Inference đưa request vào hàng đợi (queue) để xử lý sau.

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn C (Spark connector + Both stores): o Amazon SageMaker Feature Store Spark Connector: Đây là công cụ được tối ưu hóa để làm việc với Amazon EMR và các job xử lý dữ liệu Spark. Nó cho phép nạp (ingest) khối lượng dữ liệu lớn từ Spark DataFrames vào Feature Store một cách hiệu quả mà không cần viết vòng lặp gọi API thủ công. o Requirements: Đề bài yêu cầu cập nhật \"online store\" ngay lập tức (real- time availability) VÀ duy trì \"offline store\" cho batch processing. Khi sử dụng Spark Connector và bật cờ (flag) cho cả hai store (OnlineStore=True, OfflineStore=True), Feature Store sẽ tự động đồng bộ dữ liệu vào cả hai nơi: Online (DynamoDB) cho độ trễ thấp và Offline (S3) cho lưu trữ lịch sử. Đây là giải pháp \"một mũi tên trúng hai đích\" chuẩn xác nhất cho ngữ cảnh EMR. Tại sao không chọn A (PutRecord API to Online): Dùng PutRecord API đơn lẻ trong vòng lặp (loop) để nạp một \"large dataset\" từ EMR là không hiệu quả về mặt hiệu năng (throughput thấp, latency cao do round-trip network). Ngoài ra, nếu chỉ ingest vào Online store mà không cấu hình tự động sync sang Offline store (hoặc không enable Offline store ngay từ đầu), bạn có thể mất dữ liệu lịch sử hoặc phải thực hiện thêm bước copy phức tạp. Tại sao không chọn B (PutRecord API to Offline): PutRecord không hỗ trợ ghi trực tiếp vào Offline store theo cách update real-time để phục vụ inference ngay lập tức. Offline Store thường có độ trễ (latency) khi dữ liệu xuất hiện trên S3 (do buffering). Hơn nữa, yêu cầu quan trọng là \"online store is updated... as soon as available\", việc ghi vào Offline store vi phạm điều này. Tại sao không chọn D (Spark connector + Only Online): Nếu chỉ bật Online store, bạn sẽ mất tính năng lưu trữ lịch sử (Historical data retention) trên S3 phục vụ cho training và batch processing sau này.

Điều này đồng nghĩa với việc chúng cần các môi trường runtime và thư viện dependencies khác nhau, tức là cần các Container Image khác nhau. SageMaker Multi-Container Endpoint (MCE) cho phép bạn triển khai tối đa 15 container khác nhau trên cùng một Endpoint (và cùng một instance EC2). o Inference Pipeline: Tính năng MCE chính là nền tảng để xây dựng Serial Inference Pipeline (chuỗi xử lý tuần tự: Tiền xử lý -> Model A -> Hậu xử lý). o Cost-effective: Thay vì dựng 4 endpoint riêng biệt (tốn tiền cho 4 instance chạy liên tục), bạn gom cả 4 container này vào 1 endpoint duy nhất, chạy trên 1 instance (hoặc 1 cluster nhỏ), giúp tiết kiệm chi phí hạ tầng đáng kể. o Direct Invocation: Với Multi-Container Endpoint, khách hàng có thể invoke toàn bộ pipeline hoặc (tùy cấu hình) gọi trực tiếp đến một container cụ thể trong nhóm bằng cách sử dụng header TargetContainerHostname trong API invoke_endpoint. Tại sao không chọn A (Multi-model endpoint - MME): o MME được thiết kế để host hàng ngàn mô hình chia sẻ chung một Container (ví dụ: 1000 model XGBoost chạy trên 1 container XGBoost). o Vì các model trong đề bài dùng \"different frameworks\", chúng không thể dễ dàng chia sẻ chung một container (trừ khi dùng Triton Inference Server cấu hình phức tạp). MME không giải quyết vấn đề \"khác biệt môi trường/framework\" tốt bằng Multi-Container Endpoint. Tại sao không chọn C (Multiple single-model endpoints): o Đây là giải pháp tốn kém nhất. Bạn phải trả tiền cho ít nhất 4 instance chạy 24/7 (mỗi endpoint cần ít nhất 1 instance). So với việc gộp lại (Option B), chi phí sẽ cao gấp 4 lần.

Do đó, script phải được đặt trong phần \"Start Notebook\" (On-Start) của Lifecycle Configuration. Tại sao không chọn B (Create Notebook section): Script trong phần \"Create Notebook\" (On-Create) chỉ chạy duy nhất một lần khi bạn tạo mới instance lần đầu tiên. Nếu bạn tắt (Stop) instance và bật lại vào ngày hôm sau, script giám sát sẽ không được chạy lại, dẫn đến tính năng tự động tắt bị vô hiệu hóa. Tại sao không chọn C (CloudWatch CPU metric): o Về mặt kỹ thuật, CPU Utilization của một instance đang chạy không bao giờ bằng 0 (do các tiến trình hệ điều hành nền). Việc đặt ngưỡng trigger dựa trên CPU thường không chính xác bằng việc kiểm tra trực tiếp trạng thái kết nối của Jupyter Kernel (như script ở đáp án A làm). o Triển khai giải pháp này phức tạp hơn nhiều (cần Lambda, Alarm, IAM) so với dùng Lifecycle Script có sẵn. Tại sao không chọn D (CloudWatch Memory metric): Tương tự như C, Memory Utilization không bao giờ về 0 khi máy đang chạy. Dùng RAM để xác định trạng thái \"idle\" là sai về mặt nguyên lý quản trị hệ thống."

    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn B (Serverless Inference): o Cost-effective for Intermittent Traffic: SageMaker Serverless Inference là giải pháp lý tưởng cho các mô hình có lưu lượng truy cập không đều đặn (intermittent) hoặc có khoảng thời gian không hoạt động (idle). Bạn chỉ phải trả tiền cho thời gian tính toán (compute duration) khi có request xử lý và dung lượng bộ nhớ sử dụng. Khi không có traffic (sau giờ làm việc), chi phí là bằng 0 vì nó tự động scale về 0. o Provisioned Concurrency: Để đảm bảo độ trễ thấp (real-time) trong giờ cao điểm (\"business hours\"), bạn có thể cấu hình Provisioned Concurrency (Khả năng đồng thời được cung cấp trước) để giữ cho các hàm \"ấm\" (warm), tránh hiện tượng Cold Start. Đây là sự cân bằng tốt nhất giữa chi phí và hiệu năng. Tại sao không chọn A (Real-time endpoint): SageMaker Real-time Endpoint sử dụng các instance EC2 dành riêng (provisioned instances). Bạn phải trả tiền cho thời gian instance bật, bất kể có traffic hay không. Với lưu lượng \"intermittent\" (lúc có lúc không), bạn sẽ lãng phí tiền cho các khoảng thời gian instance chạy nhàn rỗi (idle time). Tại sao không chọn C (Asynchronous Inference): Async Inference được thiết kế cho các tác vụ xử lý lâu (long-running) hoặc payload lớn (lên đến 1GB), và mô hình hoạt động là không đồng bộ (trả về Job ID để poll kết quả sau). Nó không phù hợp với yêu cầu \"real-time predictions\" (phản hồi tức thì) như Serverless hoặc Real-time Endpoint. Tại sao không chọn D (Lambda activation): Việc dùng Lambda để \"bật/tắt\" endpoint thực chất là tạo và xóa endpoint hàng ngày. Quá trình tạo endpoint mới có thể mất vài phút đến hàng chục phút, gây gián đoạn dịch vụ vào đầu giờ làm việc. Ngoài ra, trong giờ làm việc, nếu dùng Real-time endpoint thì vẫn bị vấn đề chi phí cho thời gian nhàn rỗi như Option A."

    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn C (SageMaker Ground Truth): o Để huấn luyện một mô hình học sâu có giám sát (supervised deep learning model), điều kiện tiên quyết là phải có dữ liệu được gán nhãn (labeled data). Dữ liệu hiện tại là \"unlabeled images\" (ảnh chưa gán nhãn). o Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth là dịch vụ chuyên biệt giúp xây dựng các bộ dữ liệu huấn luyện chính xác cao bằng cách kết hợp sức người (human labelers) và máy học (auto-labeling). Nó cung cấp giao diện và quy trình quản lý job gán nhãn một cách hệ thống. Tại sao chọn D (Private Workforce): o Yêu cầu bảo mật: Đề bài nêu rõ \"dataset... only employees should access\" (chỉ nhân viên mới được truy cập). Điều này loại bỏ hoàn toàn khả năng sử dụng lực lượng lao động công cộng (Public Workforce) như Amazon Mechanical Turk hay các nhà cung cấp bên thứ ba (Vendor Workforce). o Private Workforce cho phép bạn định nghĩa một nhóm người dùng cụ thể (nhân viên nội bộ) và cấp quyền truy cập an toàn cho họ để thực hiện task gán nhãn mà không để lộ dữ liệu ra bên ngoài. o Độ chính xác: Yêu cầu \"highest possible accuracy\" thường đạt được tốt nhất khi sử dụng chuyên gia nội bộ (Subject Matter Experts) hiểu rõ nghiệp vụ để gán nhãn và review thủ công (human-in-the-loop). Tại sao không chọn A (Amazon Rekognition): o Amazon Rekognition trả về các nhãn tổng quát (generic labels) dựa trên mô hình đã huấn luyện sẵn của AWS. Các nhãn này có thể không khớp với danh mục (classes) cụ thể mà bài toán của bạn yêu cầu. Ngoài ra, độ chính xác cho các dữ liệu đặc thù (domain-specific) sẽ không cao bằng việc con người gán nhãn trực tiếp. Tại sao không chọn B (Train on raw data): o Đề bài yêu cầu huấn luyện mô hình Supervised (Có giám sát). Định nghĩa của Supervised Learning là mô hình học từ các cặp (Input, Label). Việc dùng dữ liệu thô chưa gán nhãn (Raw data) để training trực tiếp thuộc về lĩnh vực Unsupervised Learning (Học không giám sát), sai với yêu cầu đề bài.

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn B (S3 path + Recipe job): o DataBrew Dataset (S3 Path): AWS Glue DataBrew hỗ trợ kết nối trực tiếp (native) với Amazon S3. Bạn chỉ cần trỏ đến đường dẫn S3 (S3 path) để tạo Dataset mà không cần qua bất kỳ driver trung gian nào. o Recipe Job: Trong DataBrew, tập hợp các bước biến đổi dữ liệu (như làm sạch, chuẩn hóa, đổi tên cột, xử lý null...) được gọi là một \"Recipe\". Để áp dụng các bước này lên toàn bộ tập dữ liệu lớn và xuất kết quả ra, bạn phải chạy một Recipe Job. Đây chính xác là công cụ để thực hiện yêu cầu \"clean and normalize the data\". Tại sao không chọn A (Profile job): o DataBrew Profile Job dùng để chạy thống kê mô tả (descriptive statistics) về dữ liệu (như phân phối giá trị, độ tương quan, chất lượng dữ liệu). Nó chỉ tạo ra một bản báo cáo (Profile) về dữ liệu chứ không thực hiện việc biến đổi hay tạo ra dataset mới đã được làm sạch. Tại sao không chọn C và D (JDBC driver): o JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) là giao thức dùng để kết nối với các cơ sở dữ liệu quan hệ (như RDS, Redshift, SQL Server). Amazon S3 là dịch vụ lưu trữ đối tượng (Object Storage), không phải Database, nên không sử dụng JDBC driver để kết nối trong DataBrew. DataBrew kết nối S3 trực tiếp."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn A (AWS Glue Relationalize): o AWS Glue là dịch vụ ETL serverless (không cần quản lý máy chủ), giúp giảm tối đa gánh nặng vận hành (Least operational overhead). o Relationalize Transform: Đây là một hàm chuyển đổi có sẵn và chuyên biệt trong thư viện AWS Glue. Nó được thiết kế để tự động làm phẳng (flatten) các cấu trúc dữ liệu lồng nhau phức tạp (nested JSON) thành dạng bảng (tabular/relational) gồm các cột và hàng. Bạn không cần phải viết code phức tạp để duyệt từng node trong JSON. o Đây là giải pháp \"chuẩn sách giáo khoa\" của AWS cho việc xử lý dữ liệu nested JSON trước khi đưa vào huấn luyện mô hình (như XGBoost yêu cầu dữ liệu bảng). Tại sao không chọn B (EMR Serverless + Custom Scala): o Mặc dù EMR Serverless giảm bớt việc quản lý server, nhưng việc phải viết code Scala tùy chỉnh để phân tích cú pháp và làm phẳng file JSON lồng nhau là một công việc tốn kém thời gian và công sức phát triển (High development overhead) so với việc gọi một hàm có sẵn trong Glue. Tại sao không chọn C (Lambda + Python reduce): o Sử dụng hàm reduce() để làm phẳng JSON thủ công là việc \"phát minh lại bánh xe\" (reinventing the wheel). Nó phức tạp, dễ lỗi và khó bảo trì. Ngoài ra, Lambda có giới hạn về thời gian chạy (15 phút) và bộ nhớ, có thể không xử lý tốt nếu file dữ liệu lớn. Tại sao không chọn D (Athena flatten): o Amazon Athena chủ yếu dùng để truy vấn (Query). Mặc dù SQL có thể hỗ trợ làm phẳng mảng (UNNEST/FLATTEN), nhưng việc định nghĩa schema cho JSON phức tạp và viết câu lệnh SQL để biến đổi toàn bộ dataset thành bảng phẳng thường rườm rà hơn so với Glue. Athena phù hợp để xem dữ liệu hơn là biến đổi và lưu trữ (ETL) cho training pipeline."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Câu hỏi yêu cầu một giải pháp hoàn toàn Serverless (không máy chủ) cho ứng dụng Chatbot RAG. Dưới đây là lý do chọn bộ ba này: Tại sao chọn A (Amazon Bedrock): o Amazon Bedrock là dịch vụ Serverless hoàn toàn (Fully Managed), cung cấp quyền truy cập vào các mô hình nền tảng (Foundation Models) như Claude thông qua API. Bạn không cần quản lý máy chủ hay endpoint như SageMaker (trừ khi dùng Serverless Inference, nhưng Bedrock là lựa chọn native hơn cho GenAI API). Tại sao chọn D (Lambda + API Gateway): o Đây là cặp đôi kinh điển của kiến trúc Serverless Compute trên AWS. API Gateway cung cấp điểm cuối REST/WebSocket để chat client kết nối, và AWS Lambda thực thi logic nghiệp vụ (gọi Bedrock API, xử lý context) mà không cần chạy server EC2 liên tục. Tại sao chọn E (Amazon S3): o Amazon S3 là dịch vụ lưu trữ đối tượng Serverless. Trong kiến trúc RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), S3 thường được dùng làm \"Data Source\" để chứa các tài liệu nội bộ (Knowledge Base). (Lưu ý: Mặc dù cần một Vector Database để search, nhưng S3 là nơi lưu trữ dữ liệu gốc bền vững và serverless nhất trong các lựa chọn lưu trữ được đưa ra). Tại sao không chọn B (SageMaker JumpStart): Mặc dù JumpStart giúp triển khai model nhanh, nhưng nó thường triển khai lên SageMaker Real-time Endpoints (dựa trên EC2 instances), nghĩa là bạn phải trả tiền theo giờ cho instance chạy, không phải là Serverless thực thụ. Tại sao không chọn C (EC2): EC2 là IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), yêu cầu quản lý server, vá lỗi, scaling thủ công. Nó vi phạm yêu cầu \"Serverless\". Tại sao không chọn F (RDS MySQL): Amazon RDS truyền thống yêu cầu provision instance. Dù có Aurora Serverless, nhưng trong ngữ cảnh RAG, S3 (cho raw docs) hoặc OpenSearch Serverless (cho vector) thường được ưu tiên hơn RDS MySQL tiêu chuẩn."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Tại sao chọn C (SageMaker Asynchronous Inference): o Xử lý Payload Lớn (100 MB): SageMaker Asynchronous Inference được thiết kế đặc biệt để xử lý các payload input có kích thước lớn (lên đến 1 GB) bằng cách upload dữ liệu lên Amazon S3 trước khi xử lý, thay vì gửi trực tiếp qua HTTP body như Real-time endpoint (thường giới hạn ở mức 6MB). o Thời gian xử lý dài (Long Prediction Times): Thuật toán di truyền trong đề bài mất \"vài phút\" để chạy. Real-time Endpoint có giới hạn timeout (mặc định 60s), nên kết nối sẽ bị ngắt trước khi model chạy xong. Async Inference cho phép thời gian xử lý lên tới 1 giờ, phù hợp hoàn hảo cho các tác vụ tốn thời gian. o Tối ưu vận hành (Least Operational Overhead): Đây là dịch vụ được quản lý hoàn toàn (fully managed), có sẵn tính năng hàng đợi (queuing) và autoscaling (thậm chí scale về 0 khi không dùng), giúp bạn không phải tự xây dựng hệ thống queue hay quản lý server EC2 thủ công. Tại sao không chọn A (EC2) và D (ECS): Cả hai giải pháp này đều là \"Self-managed\" (Tự quản lý). Bạn sẽ phải tự cấu hình Load Balancer, tự viết code để xử lý hàng đợi (queue) cho các request lâu, và tự lo phần scaling hạ tầng. Điều này tốn nhiều công sức vận hành hơn nhiều so với giải pháp có sẵn của SageMaker. Tại sao không chọn B (Real-time Endpoint): Real-time endpoint không hỗ trợ payload 100MB và không phù hợp cho các request kéo dài vài phút (sẽ gây timeout lỗi client)."

Tại sao chọn B (Label encoding): Label encoding gán một số nguyên duy nhất cho mỗi nhãn. Với dữ liệu nhị phân \"yes\"/\"no\", nó sẽ chuyển thành 0 và 1 (ví dụ: No=0, Yes=1). Quá trình này thay thế 1 cột văn bản bằng 1 cột số, do đó số chiều của dữ liệu được giữ nguyên (1 column -> 1 column). Đây là cách đơn giản và hiệu quả nhất cho biến nhị phân. Tại sao chọn A (Binary encoding): Mặc dù với các biến có nhiều giá trị (high cardinality), Binary encoding thường tạo ra nhiều cột (logarit cơ số 2 của số lượng nhãn), nhưng với trường hợp đặc biệt chỉ có 2 giá trị (\"yes\"/\"no\"), Binary encoding hoạt động tương tự như Label encoding. Nó chuyển nhãn thành chuỗi nhị phân (0 hoặc 1) và lưu trong một cột duy nhất. Do đó, nó cũng thỏa mãn điều kiện không tăng số chiều. Tại sao không chọn C (One-hot encoding): One-hot encoding sẽ tạo ra một cột mới cho mỗi giá trị duy nhất. Với \"yes\" và \"no\", nó sẽ tạo ra 2 cột mới (ví dụ: is_yes và is_no). Việc biến 1 cột thành 2 cột vi phạm yêu cầu \"must not increase the dimensionality\". Tại sao không chọn D (Statistical imputation): Đây là kỹ thuật để điền các giá trị bị thiếu (missing values), không phải là kỹ thuật mã hóa (encoding) dữ liệu văn bản sang số. Tại sao không chọn E (Tokenization): Tokenization là bước tách văn bản thành các từ/token (thường dùng trong NLP). Bản thân nó chưa tạo ra feature số (cần qua bước vectorization như TF-IDF hay Embedding), và các bước sau đó thường làm tăng số chiều dữ liệu lên rất nhiều."
